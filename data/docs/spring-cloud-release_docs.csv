Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed environment, including the developer’s own laptop, bare metal data centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry. Release Train Version: 2023.0.3 Supported Boot Version: 3.2.7 Features: Spring Cloud focuses on providing good out of box experience for typical use cases and extensibility mechanism to cover others. Distributed/versioned configuration Service registration and discovery Routing Service-to-service calls Load balancing Circuit Breakers Distributed messaging Release Train Projects: Below we present links to the reference documentation of all the projects that contribute to this reference train. spring-cloud-build(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-build/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-bus(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-bus/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.2 spring-cloud-circuitbreaker(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-circuitbreaker/reference/3.1/) Reference Documentation, version 3.1.2 spring-cloud-commons(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.4 spring-cloud-config(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-consul(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-consul/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.2 spring-cloud-contract(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.4 spring-cloud-function(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-gateway(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.5 spring-cloud-kubernetes(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/reference/3.1/) Reference Documentation, version 3.1.3 spring-cloud-netflix(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-openfeign(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-stream(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-task(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/reference/3.1/) Reference Documentation, version 3.1.2 spring-cloud-vault(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.3 spring-cloud-zookeeper(https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-zookeeper/reference/4.1/) Reference Documentation, version 4.1.2"
