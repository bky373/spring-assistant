"What is the purpose of Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC?","The purpose of Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC is to provide repository support for the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) APIs, respectively. They aim to ease the development of applications with a consistent programming model that need to access SQL data sources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/index.html)"
"What is the difference between Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC?","Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC are two different approaches for accessing SQL data sources with Spring Data. JDBC is a traditional approach, while R2DBC is a reactive approach. They both provide repository support, but R2DBC is designed for reactive programming and can provide better performance and scalability in certain scenarios. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/index.html)"
"Does Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC support Kotlin?","Yes, Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC support Kotlin. There is a specific section in the documentation that provides information on Kotlin-specific support. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/index.html)"
"Where can I find instructions for upgrading from earlier versions of Spring Data?","Instructions for upgrading from earlier versions of Spring Data are provided on the project wiki (Source: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki)."
"How do I find the version I want to upgrade to?","Follow the instructions in the release notes section (Source: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki#release-notes) to find the version that you want to upgrade to."
"What should I do if I am more than one release behind?","If you are more than one release behind, please make sure that you also review the release notes of the versions that you jumped (Source: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/wiki#release-notes)."
"What is the primary objective of the Spring Data repository abstraction?","The goal of the Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/introduction.html)"
"What are the core concepts explained in the 'Introduction' chapter of Spring Data repositories?","The core concepts explained in the 'Introduction' chapter of Spring Data repositories include Defining Repository Interfaces, Creating Repository Instances, Defining Query Methods, Projections, Object Mapping Fundamentals, Custom Conversions, Custom Repository Implementations, Spring Data Extensions, Value Expressions Fundamentals, Query by Example, Publishing Events from Aggregate Roots, Entity Callbacks, Null Handling of Repository Methods, Repository query keywords, and Repository query return types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'core-concepts.html' section in the Spring Data repositories documentation?","The 'core-concepts.html' section in the Spring Data repositories documentation provides an overview of the fundamental concepts related to Spring Data repositories. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/introduction.html)"
"What is the central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction and what does it do?","The central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction is Repository. It acts as a marker interface to capture the types to work with and to help discover interfaces that extend this one. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the methods provided by the CrudRepository interface and what do they do?","The CrudRepository interface provides the following methods: save(S entity), findById(ID primaryKey), findAll(), count(), delete(T entity), and existsById(ID primaryKey). These methods are commonly referred to as CRUD methods and offer sophisticated CRUD functionality for the entity class being managed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the additional methods provided by the PagingAndSortingRepository interface and how can they be used?","The PagingAndSortingRepository interface provides additional methods for paginated access to entities: findAll(Sort sort) and Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable). To access the second page of User by a page size of 20, you could do something like the following: Page<User> users = repository.findAll(PageRequest.of(1, 20)); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"How do you define a repository interface in Spring Data?","To define a repository interface, you first need to define a domain class-specific repository interface. The interface must extend Repository and be typed to the domain class and an ID type. If you want to expose CRUD methods for that domain type, you may extend CrudRepository , or one of its variants instead of Repository . (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"What is the difference between CrudRepository and ListCrudRepository in Spring Data?","CrudRepository gives you methods for CRUD functionality. With version 3.0 we also introduced ListCrudRepository which is very similar to the CrudRepository but for those methods that return multiple entities it returns a List instead of an Iterable which you might find easier to use. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How can you fine-tune the definition of a repository interface in Spring Data?","There are a few variants how you can get started with your repository interface. The typical approach is to extend CrudRepository , which gives you methods for CRUD functionality. If you are using a reactive store you might choose ReactiveCrudRepository , or RxJava3CrudRepository depending on which reactive framework you are using. If you are using Kotlin you might pick CoroutineCrudRepository which utilizes Kotlin’s coroutines. Additional you can extend PagingAndSortingRepository , ReactiveSortingRepository , RxJava3SortingRepository , or CoroutineSortingRepository if you need methods that allow to specify a Sort abstraction or in the first case a Pageable abstraction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How does Spring Data determine the actual query to be created for a repository method?","Spring Data uses a query lookup strategy to determine the actual query to be created for a repository method. The strategy can be configured through XML or Java configuration. The default strategy is CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND, which first looks up a declared query and, if not found, creates a custom method name-based query. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-methods-details.html#query-lookup-strategies)"
"What are the different query creation strategies available in Spring Data?","The available query creation strategies in Spring Data are CREATE, USE_DECLARED_QUERY, and CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND. The CREATE strategy attempts to construct a store-specific query from the method name. The USE_DECLARED_QUERY strategy tries to find a manually defined query and throws an exception if it cannot find one. The CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND strategy combines CREATE and USE_DECLARED_QUERY, first looking up a declared query and, if not found, creating a custom method name-based query. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-methods-details.html#query-creation)"
"How can I handle large query results in Spring Data?","To handle large query results in Spring Data, you can use different methods such as List, Streamable, Stream, Flux, Slice, and Page. Each method has its own advantages and constraints. For example, using a List returns all results at once, which can be memory-intensive, while using a Stream returns results one by one, which can be more efficient for large datasets. You can also use pagination, sorting, and limiting to manage large query results. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-methods-details.html#paging-iterating-large-results-sorting-limiting)"
"What are projections in Spring Data and why are they useful?","Projections in Spring Data are used to create partial views of managed aggregates, allowing developers to retrieve only specific attributes of those types. This is useful when you want to limit the amount of data returned by a query, improving performance and reducing unnecessary data transfer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"How can you limit the result of a query to only the name attributes in Spring Data?","To limit the result of a query to only the name attributes, you can declare an interface that exposes accessor methods for the properties to be read. This is known as an interface-based projection. The query execution engine creates proxy instances of that interface at runtime for each element returned and forwards calls to the exposed methods to the target object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"What is the difference between closed and open projections in Spring Data?","A closed projection is a projection interface whose accessor methods all match properties of the target aggregate. Spring Data can optimize the query execution when using a closed projection because it knows about all the attributes needed to back the projection proxy. An open projection is a projection interface where accessor methods can also be used to compute new values by using the @Value annotation. Spring Data cannot apply query execution optimizations in this case because the SpEL expression could use any attribute of the aggregate root. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"How does Spring Data determine the constructor to use for object creation?","Spring Data automatically tries to detect a persistent entity’s constructor to be used to materialize objects of that type. The resolution algorithm works as follows: If there is a single static factory method annotated with @PersistenceCreator then it is used. If there is a single constructor, it is used. If there are multiple constructors and exactly one is annotated with @PersistenceCreator , it is used. If the type is a Java Record the canonical constructor is used. If there’s a no-argument constructor, it is used. Other constructors will be ignored. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/object-mapping.html)"
"What is the difference between property population and object creation in Spring Data object mapping?","Object creation involves creating instances of domain objects and mapping the store-native data structures onto those. Property population, on the other hand, involves setting the remaining persistent properties of an entity instance after it has been created. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/object-mapping.html)"
"How does Spring Data handle overridden properties in Kotlin?","Spring Data adapts specifics of Kotlin to allow object creation and mutation. However, delegated properties are not supported with Spring Data. The mapping metadata filters delegated properties for Kotlin Data classes. In all other cases, you can exclude synthetic fields for delegated properties by annotating the property with @delegate:org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/object-mapping.html)"
"What does the @ReadingConverter annotation do in Spring Converter implementations?","The @ReadingConverter annotation is used in Spring Converter implementations to register a converter as a reading converter. It is used when the source type is a native type that can be handled natively by the underlying data access API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/custom-conversions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the CustomConversions class in Spring Data?","The CustomConversions class in Spring Data is the central facility that allows registration and querying for registered converters based on source and target type. It ships with a pre-defined set of converter registrations, including JSR-310 Converters for conversion between java.time, java.util.Date, and String types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/custom-conversions.html)"
"How can you force the infrastructure to register a converter for only one way in Spring Data?","You can force the infrastructure to register a converter for only one way in Spring Data by using the @ReadingConverter and @WritingConverter annotations in the converter implementation. These annotations allow you to specify whether the converter should be registered as a reading or writing converter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/custom-conversions.html)"
"How can you customize a Spring Data repository with additional functionality?","To customize a Spring Data repository, you need to define a fragment interface and an implementation for the custom functionality. The interface should declare the custom methods, and the implementation should provide the actual implementation. The class name of the implementation should follow the naming convention of appending the postfix 'Impl'. Then, you can let your repository interface extend the fragment interface. This combination of the CRUD and custom functionality is then available to clients. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/custom-implementations.html>)"
"How can you reuse customizations across different repositories in Spring Data?","You can reuse customizations across different repositories in Spring Data by creating a repository fragment interface and its implementation. Multiple repositories can use the fragment interface, allowing you to reuse the customizations. The fragment interface and its implementation can be imported into the repository interfaces, and they are combined with the CRUD and other custom functionality. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/custom-implementations.html>)"
"How can you customize the base repository behavior in Spring Data?","To customize the base repository behavior in Spring Data, you can create an implementation that extends the persistence technology-specific repository base class. This class then acts as a custom base class for the repository proxies. The final step is to make the Spring Data infrastructure aware of the customized repository base class by using the repositoryBaseClass in configuration. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/custom-implementations.html>)"
"What is Querydsl and what is its purpose in Spring Data?","Querydsl is a framework that enables the construction of statically typed SQL-like queries through its fluent API. In Spring Data, Querydsl integration is provided through the QuerydslPredicateExecutor interface, which allows for the execution of type-safe queries using Querydsl Predicate instances. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-extensions.html>)"
"How can you enable Spring Data web support in a JavaConfig configuration class?","You can enable Spring Data web support in a JavaConfig configuration class by using the @EnableSpringDataWebSupport annotation. This annotation registers several components, including support for domain class conversion, Pageable and Sort resolution, and Jackson modules for de-/serializing types like Point and Distance. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-extensions.html>)"
"How can you use a PagedResourcesAssembler as a controller method argument to create a hypermedia-enabled representation of a Page instance?","To use a PagedResourcesAssembler as a controller method argument, you need to add the PagedResourcesAssembler as a method argument and call the toModel() method on it. This will create a PagedModel instance with the content of the Page, pagination metadata, and hypermedia links. The toModel() method also automatically resolves the parameters into a Pageable for an upcoming request. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-extensions.html>)"
"What is the purpose of Value Expressions in Spring Boot?","Value Expressions are a combination of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and Property Placeholder Resolution. They allow developers to evaluate powerful expressions and obtain values from the Environment such as configuration properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/value-expressions.html)"
"How can Value Expressions be defined in Spring Boot?","Value Expressions can be defined from a sole SpEL Expression, a Property Placeholder, or a composite expression mixing various expressions including literals. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/value-expressions.html)"
"What is the importance of parsing and evaluation in Value Expressions?","Parsing and Evaluation of Value Expressions are handled by the ValueExpressionParser API. Instances of ValueExpression are thread-safe and can be cached for later use to avoid repeated parsing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/value-expressions.html)"
"What is Query by Example (QBE) and how does it differ from traditional querying techniques?","Query by Example (QBE) is a user-friendly querying technique that allows dynamic query creation without requiring the use of store-specific query languages. It simplifies the process of querying data stores by eliminating the need to write queries with field names. Instead, users can create queries using a domain object with populated fields. This approach is well suited for querying data stores with static or dynamic constraints and is independent of the underlying data store API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the key components of the Query by Example API and how do they work together?","The Query by Example API consists of four main components: Probe, ExampleMatcher, Example, and FetchableFluentQuery. The Probe is the domain object with populated fields that serves as the basis for the query. The ExampleMatcher carries details on how to match particular fields and can be reused across multiple Examples. An Example consists of the probe and the ExampleMatcher and is used to create the query. The FetchableFluentQuery offers a fluent API for further customization of a query derived from an Example, allowing the specification of ordering, projection, and result processing. These components work together to provide a flexible and user-friendly querying experience. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the limitations of Query by Example, and how can users address these limitations?","Query by Example has several limitations, including no support for nested or grouped property constraints, store-specific support for string matching, and exact matching for other property types. Users can address these limitations by using the ExampleMatcher to specify their own defaults for string matching, null handling, and property-specific settings. Additionally, users can tune the matcher options and case sensitivity for individual properties. By default, the ExampleMatcher expects all values set on the probe to match, but users can use ExampleMatcher.matchingAny() to get results matching any of the predicates defined. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/query-by-example.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @DomainEvents annotation in Spring Data?","The @DomainEvents annotation in Spring Data is used to make the publication of domain events as easy as possible for aggregate roots. It can be used on a method of your aggregate root to return either a single event instance or a collection of events. It must not take any arguments. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @AfterDomainEventPublication annotation in Spring Data?","The @AfterDomainEventPublication annotation in Spring Data is used to potentially clean the list of events to be published (among other uses). It is called after all events have been published. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"When are the methods annotated with @DomainEvents and @AfterDomainEventPublication called?","The methods annotated with @DomainEvents and @AfterDomainEventPublication are called every time one of the following Spring Data repository methods are called: save(...), saveAll(...), delete(...), deleteAll(...), deleteAllInBatch(...), deleteInBatch(...). Note that deleteById(...) is notably absent as the implementations might choose to issue a query deleting the instance and thus we would never have access to the aggregate instance in the first place. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"What are Entity Callbacks in Spring Data?","Entity Callbacks are hooks provided by the Spring Data infrastructure that allow for modifying an entity before and after certain methods are invoked. They provide a convenient way to check and potentially modify an entity in a callback-fashioned style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/entity-callbacks.html)"
"What is the recommended way of applying entity modifications in Spring Data?","The recommended way of applying entity modifications in Spring Data is through Entity Callbacks. This approach provides integration points with both synchronous and reactive APIs to guarantee in-order execution at well-defined checkpoints within the processing chain, returning a potentially modified entity or a reactive wrapper type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/entity-callbacks.html)"
"How are Entity Callbacks registered in Spring Data?","EntityCallback beans are picked up by the store-specific implementations in case they are registered in the ApplicationContext. Most template APIs already implement ApplicationContextAware and therefore have access to the ApplicationContext. Entity Callbacks can be registered using various methods, such as component annotation, @Order annotation, or implementing the Ordered interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/entity-callbacks.html)"
"What type of wrapper does Spring Data use to indicate the potential absence of a value for repository CRUD methods returning an individual aggregate instance?","Java 8's Optional (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/null-handling.html)"
"What are the alternative wrapper types that Spring Data supports for query methods?","com.google.common.base.Optional, scala.Option, and io.vavr.control.Option (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/null-handling.html)"
"What happens if a query result violates the defined nullability constraints in a repository query method?","An exception is thrown (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/null-handling.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring Data repository query derivation mechanism?","The Spring Data repository query derivation mechanism is used to express the predicate and support various query method subjects and predicate keywords. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html)"
"What are the general query method returning types in Spring Data repository query derivation?","The general query method returning types in Spring Data repository query derivation are typically the repository type, a Collection or Streamable subtype, or a result wrapper such as Page, GeoResults, or any other store-specific result wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html)"
"What are the supported query method predicate keywords in Spring Data repository query derivation?","The supported query method predicate keywords in Spring Data repository query derivation include AND, OR, AFTER, BEFORE, CONTAINING, BETWEEN, ENDING_WITH, EXISTS, FALSE, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_EQUAL, IN, IS, IS_EMPTY, IS_NOT_EMPTY, IS_NOT_NULL, IS_NULL, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_EQUAL, LIKE, NEAR, NOT, NOT_IN, NOT_LIKE, REGEX, STARTING_WITH, TRUE, WITHIN. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html)"
"What is the return type for a Spring Data repository query that expects to return one result at most, and if no result is found, null is returned?","T (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-return-types-reference.html)"
"What type of collection is returned when a Spring Data repository query method is annotated with @Async and requires Spring's asynchronous method execution capability?","Future<T> or CompletableFuture<T> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-return-types-reference.html)"
"What is the return type for a Spring Data repository query that returns a sized chunk of data with an indication of whether there is more data available?","Slice<T> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-return-types-reference.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring Data JDBC module?","The Spring Data JDBC module applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions that use JDBC database drivers aligned with Domain-driven design principles. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc.html)"
"What is the 'template' abstraction used for in Spring Data JDBC?","The 'template' abstraction is used as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying aggregates in Spring Data JDBC. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc.html)"
"Where can I find information on how to get started with Spring Data JDBC?","You can find information on how to get started with Spring Data JDBC in the 'Getting Started' section of the Spring Data JDBC reference guide. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc.html)"
"What is the main difference between Spring Data JDBC and JPA?","Spring Data JDBC aims to be simpler conceptually by not doing lazy loading or caching, and not tracking changes to entities. It offers limited support for customizing the strategy with annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/why.html)"
"Why is there a need for Spring Data JDBC when JPA already exists?","Spring Data JDBC is designed to be simpler and more straightforward for certain use cases, focusing on simplicity and ease of understanding. It is an alternative for developers who prefer a simpler approach to persistence. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/why.html)"
"What are the main design decisions behind Spring Data JDBC?","Spring Data JDBC's design decisions include not using lazy loading or caching, not tracking changes to entities, and offering limited support for customizing the strategy with annotations. It is designed to work for simpler cases and requires developers to code their own strategies if needed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/why.html)"
"What is the importance of 'repository', 'aggregate', and 'aggregate root' concepts in Spring Data JDBC?","The concepts of 'repository', 'aggregate', and 'aggregate root' are inspired by Domain Driven Design and are crucial for Spring Data JDBC. They are contrary to normal practice when working with relational databases. A repository is an abstraction over a persistent store that looks like a collection of all the aggregates of a certain type. An aggregate is a group of entities that is guaranteed to be consistent between atomic changes to it. Aggregates have exactly one aggregate root, which is one of the entities of the aggregate. The aggregate gets manipulated only through methods on that aggregate root. These are the atomic changes mentioned earlier. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/domain-driven-design.html)"
"What is the relationship between entities and aggregates in Spring Data JDBC?","In Spring Data JDBC, entities reachable from an aggregate root are considered to be part of that aggregate root. Spring Data JDBC assumes that only the aggregate has a foreign key to a table storing non-root entities of the aggregate and no other entity points toward non-root entities. Entities referenced from an aggregate root are deleted and recreated by Spring Data JDBC. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/domain-driven-design.html)"
"How can you customize the behavior of repositories in Spring Data JDBC?","You can overwrite the repository methods with implementations that match your style of working and designing your database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/domain-driven-design.html)"
"How can I bootstrap a working environment for Spring Data JDBC?","An easy way to bootstrap setting up a working environment is to create a Spring-based project in Spring Tools (https://spring.io/tools) or from Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io)."
"What are the requirements for using Spring Data JDBC?","Spring Data JDBC requires Spring Framework (https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1) 6.1.13 and above. In terms of databases, Spring Data JDBC requires a dialect (#jdbc.dialects) to abstract common SQL functionality over vendor-specific flavours. Spring Data JDBC includes direct support for the following databases: DB2, H2, HSQLDB, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and Postgres. If you use a different database, your application won't start up. The dialect (#jdbc.dialects) section contains further detail on how to proceed in such case."
"How can I create a Spring project in STS and set up the necessary dependencies for Spring Data JDBC?","To create a Spring project in STS, go to File → New → Spring Template Project → Simple Spring Utility Project, and press Yes when prompted. Then enter a project and a package name, such as org.spring.jdbc.example. Add the following to the pom.xml files dependencies element: <dependencies> <!-- other dependency elements omitted --> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId> <artifactId>spring-data-jdbc</artifactId> <version>3.3.4</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Change the version of Spring in the pom.xml to be <spring.version>6.1.13</spring.version> Add the following location of the Spring Milestone repository for Maven to your pom.xml such that it is at the same level as your <dependencies/> element: <repositories> <repository> <id>spring-milestone</id> <name>Spring Maven MILESTONE Repository</name> <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url> </repository> </repositories> The repository is also browseable here (https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/data/)."
"How can you perform aggregate persistence using Spring Data JDBC?","You can perform aggregate persistence using the CrudRepository.save(...) method in Spring Data JDBC. If the aggregate is new, it will result in an insert for the aggregate root and subsequent insert statements for all directly or indirectly referenced entities. If the aggregate root is not new, all referenced entities will be deleted, the aggregate root will be updated, and all referenced entities will be inserted again. Note that whether an instance is new is part of the instance’s state. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/entity-persistence.html)"
"What are the limitations of Spring Data JDBC when updating an aggregate?","Spring Data JDBC has some limitations when updating an aggregate. It does not know the previous state of an aggregate, so any update process always has to take whatever it finds in the database and make sure it converts it to whatever is the state of the entity passed to the save method. This can be wasteful if only a few of the referenced entities have been actually changed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/entity-persistence.html)"
"What is Single Query Loading in Spring Data JDBC and what are its limitations?","Single Query Loading in Spring Data JDBC is a feature that allows the loading of arbitrarily complex aggregates with a single SQL query, which can be more efficient than loading aggregates with separate statements. However, there are certain limitations to Single Query Loading. It is restricted to aggregates without nested collections, it does not support AggregateReference or embedded entities, and it is only supported by some database dialects. It also only works for the find methods in CrudRepository, not for derived queries and not for annotated queries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/entity-persistence.html)"
"What is the name of the class that provides rich mapping support in Spring Data JDBC?","The BasicJdbcConverter (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/mapping.html)"
"How does the BasicJdbcConverter map domain objects to a data row?","The BasicJdbcConverter uses a rich metadata model that allows mapping domain objects to a data row. This mapping metadata model is populated by using annotations on your domain objects. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/mapping.html)"
"What are the conventions followed by the BasicJdbcConverter for mapping objects to rows when no additional mapping metadata is provided?","The BasicJdbcConverter has conventions for mapping objects to rows when no additional mapping metadata is provided. The conventions include mapping the short Java class name to the table name, mapping fields to column names, using a custom NamingStrategy to control the mapping, and using any Spring Converters registered with CustomConversions to override the default mapping of object properties to row columns and values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/mapping.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Query annotation in Spring Data JDBC?","The @Query annotation in Spring Data JDBC is used to declare a query method. It can be used to specify a custom RowMapper or ResultSetExtractor to use. The attributes rowMapperClass and resultSetExtractorClass allow you to specify classes to use, which will get instantiated using a default constructor.
