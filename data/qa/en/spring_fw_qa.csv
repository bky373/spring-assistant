"What is the main purpose of Spring Framework in Java enterprise applications?","The main purpose of Spring Framework is to make it easy to create Java enterprise applications. It provides everything you need to embrace the Java language in an enterprise environment, with support for Groovy and Kotlin as alternative languages on the JVM, and with the flexibility to create many kinds of architectures depending on an application’s needs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/overview.html)"
"What is the current required Java version for Spring Framework?","As of Spring Framework 6.0, Spring requires Java 17+. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/overview.html)"
"What is the difference between the term 'Spring' and the 'Spring Framework'?","The term 'Spring' can refer to the Spring Framework project itself, which is where it all started. Over time, other Spring projects have been built on top of the Spring Framework. Most often, when people say 'Spring', they mean the entire family of projects. The Spring Framework is divided into modules, and applications can choose which modules they need. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/overview.html)"
"What is the core technology of the Spring Framework?","The core technology of the Spring Framework is its Inversion of Control (IoC) container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's AOP framework?","Spring's AOP framework is designed to address the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming. It is conceptually easy to understand and serves as an alternative to AspectJ, which is currently the richest and most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core.html)"
"What is AOT processing and how is it used in the Spring Framework?","AOT (Ahead-of-Time) processing is a technique used to optimize applications ahead of deployment. In the context of the Spring Framework, it is typically used for native image deployment using GraalVM. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container?","The Spring IoC container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of objects, providing dependencies to them, and controlling their scope. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html#beans-overview)"
"What is a bean in the context of Spring's IoC container?","A bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC container. It can be created, configured, and managed by the container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html#beans-definition)"
"How can you define dependencies for a bean in Spring?","Dependencies for a bean can be defined using constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html#beans-definition-dependencies)"
"What is the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle and how does it relate to Dependency Injection (DI) in the context of Spring Framework?","The Inversion of Control (IoC) principle is a design principle in which an object's dependencies are injected rather than constructed or located by the object itself. Dependency Injection (DI) is a specialized form of IoC where objects define their dependencies through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties set after construction or return from a factory method. In Spring Framework, the IoC container injects these dependencies when it creates the bean, which is fundamentally the inverse of the bean controlling its own dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html)"
"What is the difference between the BeanFactory and ApplicationContext interfaces in Spring Framework?","The BeanFactory interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object. The ApplicationContext is a sub-interface of BeanFactory that adds additional enterprise-specific functionality, such as easier integration with Spring's AOP features, message resource handling for internationalization, event publication, and application-layer specific contexts like the WebApplicationContext for web applications. The ApplicationContext is a complete superset of the BeanFactory and is used exclusively in descriptions of Spring's IoC container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html)"
"What are beans in the context of Spring Framework and how are they managed by the Spring IoC container?","Beans in Spring Framework are objects that are instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. They form the backbone of your application and their dependencies are reflected in the configuration metadata used by the container. In other words, beans are simply one of many objects in your application, but they are managed by the Spring IoC container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface in Spring IoC container?","The org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html)"
"What are the different formats for configuration metadata in Spring?","The configuration metadata in Spring can be represented as annotated component classes, configuration classes with factory methods, or external XML files or Groovy scripts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html)"
"How can you retrieve instances of beans in the Spring ApplicationContext?","You can retrieve instances of your beans using the method T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType) in the ApplicationContext. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html)"
"What is the purpose of a Spring IoC container and how does it manage beans?","A Spring IoC container manages one or more beans. These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container. Within the container itself, these bean definitions are represented as BeanDefinition objects, which contain the following metadata: a package-qualified class name, bean behavioral configuration elements, references to other beans, and other configuration settings. Beans are created with the configuration metadata encapsulated by that bean definition. The container looks at the recipe for a named bean when asked and uses the configuration metadata to create (or acquire) an actual object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'id' and 'name' attributes in XML-based configuration metadata?","The 'id' attribute lets you specify exactly one id for a bean. Conventionally, these names are alphanumeric, but they can contain special characters as well. The 'name' attribute can be used to specify aliases for the bean. If you want to introduce other aliases for the bean, you can also specify them in the name attribute, separated by a comma, semicolon, or white space. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'class' attribute in XML-based configuration metadata?","The 'class' attribute is used to specify the type (or class) of object that is to be instantiated in the <bean/> element. This attribute is usually mandatory. It can be used to specify the bean class to be constructed in the case where the container itself directly creates the bean by calling its constructor reflectively, or to specify the actual class containing the static factory method that is invoked to create the object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html)"
"What is the purpose of dependency injection in Spring Boot?","Dependency injection in Spring Boot is a technique used to collaborate objects and achieve a goal. It allows for the creation of a fully realized application where objects work together to present a cohesive application to the end-user. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies.html)"
"What is the difference between a bean definition and a fully realized application in the context of Spring Boot?","A bean definition in Spring Boot is a standalone object that is defined within the context of the application. A fully realized application, on the other hand, is the result of multiple beans working together to achieve a goal and present a cohesive application to the end-user. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies.html)"
"What is the purpose of the depends-on attribute in Spring Boot?","The depends-on attribute in Spring Boot is used to specify a dependency between beans. This allows for the order of bean instantiation to be controlled, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are initialized before the dependent bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies.html)"
"What is Dependency Injection (DI) and how does it work?","Dependency Injection (DI) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies on its own. Code is cleaner with the DI principle, and decoupling is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. DI exists in two major variants: Constructor-based dependency injection and Setter-based dependency injection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html)"
"What is the difference between Constructor-based Dependency Injection and Setter-based Dependency Injection?","Constructor-based DI is accomplished by the container invoking a constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency. Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or a no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean. It is a good rule of thumb to use constructors for mandatory dependencies and setter methods or configuration methods for optional dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html)"
"What is the Dependency Resolution Process in Spring?","The container performs bean dependency resolution by creating and initializing the ApplicationContext with configuration metadata that describes all the beans. For each bean, its dependencies are expressed in the form of properties, constructor arguments, or arguments to the static-factory method. These dependencies are provided to the bean when the bean is actually created. Each property or constructor argument is an actual definition of the value to set, or a reference to another bean in the container. Each property or constructor argument that is a value is converted from its specified format to the actual type of that property or constructor argument. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html)"
"How can you define bean properties and constructor arguments as references to other managed beans (collaborators) or as values defined inline in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata?","You can define bean properties and constructor arguments as references to other managed beans (collaborators) or as values defined inline in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata by using the <property/> and <constructor-arg/> elements. These elements support sub-element types for this purpose, such as the value attribute of the <property/> element, which specifies a property or constructor argument as a human-readable string representation. Spring's conversion service is used to convert these values from a String to the actual type of the property or argument. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-properties-detailed.html>)"
"What is the difference between using the idref element and the value attribute when passing the id of another bean in the container to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element?","The difference between using the idref element and the value attribute when passing the id of another bean in the container to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element is that using the idref tag lets the container validate at deployment time that the referenced, named bean actually exists. In contrast, using the value attribute does not provide this validation, and typos are only discovered at runtime when the client bean is instantiated. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-properties-detailed.html>)"
"How can you define an inner bean within a <property/> or <constructor-arg/> element in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata?","You can define an inner bean within a <property/> or <constructor-arg/> element in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata by placing a <bean/> element inside the <property/> or <constructor-arg/> elements. An inner bean definition does not require a defined ID or name, and it is always created with the outer bean. It is not possible to access inner beans independently or to inject them into collaborating beans other than into the enclosing bean. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-properties-detailed.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the depends-on attribute in Spring Beans?","The depends-on attribute can explicitly force one or more beans to be initialized before the bean using this element is initialized. It can also control shutdown order by ensuring dependent beans are destroyed first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-dependson.html)"
"How can you express a dependency on multiple beans using the depends-on attribute?","To express a dependency on multiple beans, supply a list of bean names as the value of the depends-on attribute (commas, whitespace, and semicolons are valid delimiters). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-dependson.html)"
"Can the depends-on attribute control shutdown order in Spring Beans?","Yes, the depends-on attribute can also control shutdown order by ensuring dependent beans are destroyed first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-dependson.html)"
"What is lazy-initialization in the context of Spring Boot?","Lazy-initialization in Spring Boot refers to the process of creating a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup. This is controlled by the lazy-init attribute on the <bean/> element in XML configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-lazy-init.html)"
"How can you prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean in Spring Boot?","You can prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as being lazy-initialized. This can be done by setting the lazy-init attribute on the <bean/> element to true. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-lazy-init.html)"
"Can you control lazy-initialization at the container level in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the default-lazy-init attribute on the <beans/> element. Setting this attribute to true will prevent all beans from being pre-instantiated when the ApplicationContext starts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-lazy-init.html)"
"What is the default autowiring mode in Spring?","The default autowiring mode in Spring is 'no'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html)"
"How does autowiring by type work in Spring?","Autowiring by type in Spring lets a property be autowired if exactly one bean of the property type exists in the container. If more than one exists, a fatal exception is thrown. If there are no matching beans, nothing happens. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html)"
"Can you autowire simple properties in Spring?","No, you cannot autowire simple properties such as primitives, Strings, and Classes (and arrays of such simple properties) in Spring. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html)"
"What is the main problem when a singleton bean needs to use a non-singleton (prototype) bean in Spring Boot?","The container creates the singleton bean only once, and thus only gets one opportunity to set the properties. The container cannot provide bean A with a new instance of bean B every time one is needed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.html)"
"How can the problem of different bean lifecycles be solved in Spring Boot?","Bean A can be made aware of the container by implementing the ApplicationContextAware interface, and by making a getBean('B') call to the container to ask for a new bean B instance every time bean A needs it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.html)"
"What is Method Injection in the Spring IoC container?","Method Injection is a feature of the Spring IoC container that lets you handle the use case of a bean needing a new instance of another bean on each method invocation, cleanly. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.html)"
"What is the default scope for beans in Spring?","The default scope for beans in Spring is singleton. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-singleton)"
"How does the prototype scope differ from the singleton scope in Spring?","The prototype scope results in the creation of a new bean instance every time a request for that specific bean is made, while the singleton scope creates exactly one instance of the object defined by that bean definition. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-prototype)"
"What is the purpose of using a custom scope in Spring?","A custom scope allows you to define your own scopes or even redefine existing scopes, although the latter is considered bad practice and you cannot override the built-in singleton and prototype scopes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-custom)"
"What are the three options for controlling bean lifecycle behavior in Spring 2.5?","The InitializingBean and DisposableBean callback interfaces, Custom init() and destroy() methods, and The @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-nature.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Lifecycle interface in Spring?","The Lifecycle interface defines the essential methods for any object that has its own lifecycle requirements (such as starting and stopping some background process). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-nature.html)"
"What is the difference between the org.springframework.context.Lifecycle interface and the org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle interface?","The org.springframework.context.Lifecycle interface is a plain contract for explicit start and stop notifications and does not imply auto-startup at context refresh time. The org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle interface, on the other hand, provides fine-grained control over auto-startup and for graceful stopping of a specific bean, including startup and stop phases. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-nature.html)"
"What is Bean Definition Inheritance in Spring Boot?","Bean Definition Inheritance is a feature in Spring Boot that allows a child bean definition to inherit configuration data from a parent bean definition. This can save a lot of typing and is a form of templating. Child bean definitions are represented by the ChildBeanDefinition class, and they can override some values or add others as needed. Most users configure bean definitions declaratively in a class such as the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext. When using XML-based configuration metadata, you can indicate a child bean definition by using the parent attribute, specifying the parent bean as the value of this attribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/child-bean-definitions.html)"
"How can I indicate a child bean definition in XML-based configuration metadata?","To indicate a child bean definition in XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the parent attribute and specify the parent bean as the value of this attribute. The following example shows how to do so: <bean id=""inheritedTestBean"" abstract=""true"" class=""org.springframework.beans.TestBean""> <property name=""name"" value=""parent""/> <property name=""age"" value=""1""/> </bean> <bean id=""inheritsWithDifferentClass"" class=""org.springframework.beans.DerivedTestBean"" parent=""inheritedTestBean"" init-method=""initialize""> <property name=""name"" value=""override""/> <!-- the age property value of 1 will be inherited from parent --> </bean> Note the parent attribute. A child bean definition uses the bean class from the parent definition if none is specified but can also override it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/child-bean-definitions.html)"
"What are the settings that a child bean definition inherits from the parent?","A child bean definition inherits scope, constructor argument values, property values, and method overrides from the parent, with the option to add new values. Any scope, initialization method, destroy method, or static factory method settings that you specify override the corresponding parent settings. The remaining settings are always taken from the child definition: depends on, autowire mode, dependency check, singleton, and lazy init. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/child-bean-definitions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the BeanPostProcessor interface in Spring IoC container?","The BeanPostProcessor interface defines callback methods that you can implement to provide your own (or override the container’s default) instantiation logic, dependency resolution logic, and so forth. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-extension.html)"
"How can you control the order in which BeanPostProcessor instances run?","You can control the order in which BeanPostProcessor instances run by setting the order property. However, you can only set this property if the BeanPostProcessor implements the Ordered interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-extension.html)"
"What is the difference between BeanPostProcessor and BeanFactoryPostProcessor?","BeanPostProcessor operates on bean (or object) instances, while BeanFactoryPostProcessor operates on the bean configuration metadata. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-extension.html)"
"What is Annotation-based Container Configuration in Spring?","Annotation-based Container Configuration in Spring is a method that provides comprehensive support for configuration using annotations on the relevant class, method, or field declaration. It operates on metadata in the component class itself and uses BeanPostProcessors in conjunction with annotations to make the core IOC container aware of specific annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config.html)"
"What are some examples of annotations supported by Spring for annotation-based configuration?","@Autowired, @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy, @Inject, and @Named are examples of annotations supported by Spring for annotation-based configuration. Details about these annotations can be found in the relevant section. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config.html)"
"How is annotation-based configuration enabled in an XML-based Spring setup?","Annotation-based configuration can be enabled in an XML-based Spring setup by including the <context:annotation-config/> element in the XML configuration. This element implicitly registers several post-processors, including ConfigurationClassPostProcessor, AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, and EventListenerMethodProcessor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config.html)"
"In Spring Boot, what is the purpose of the @Autowired annotation?","The @Autowired annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into Spring-managed objects. It can be applied to constructors, setter methods, fields, and methods with arbitrary names and multiple arguments. As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on a constructor is no longer necessary if the target bean defines only one constructor. However, if several constructors are available and there is no primary/default constructor, at least one of the constructors must be annotated with @Autowired in order to instruct the container which one to use. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.html>)"
"Can I use the @Autowired annotation in place of JSR 330's @Inject annotation in Spring Boot?","Yes, JSR 330's @Inject annotation can be used in place of Spring's @Autowired annotation in Spring Boot. See the official documentation for more details. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.html>)"
"What is the difference between the required attribute in @Autowired and the non-required attribute?","The required attribute in @Autowired indicates whether the corresponding property is required for autowiring purposes. If the required attribute is set to true (default), the autowiring process will fail if no matching candidate beans are available for the injection point. If the required attribute is set to false, the framework will skip a non-satisfiable injection point, and the property will be ignored if it cannot be autowired. This allows properties to be assigned default values that can be optionally overridden via dependency injection. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @Primary annotation in Spring's autowiring?","The @Primary annotation in Spring's autowiring is used to indicate that a particular bean should be given preference when multiple beans are candidates to be autowired to a single-valued dependency. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-primary.html)"
"How can you define a primary bean in Spring's configuration?","You can define a primary bean in Spring's configuration by using the @Primary annotation on the @Bean method that creates the bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-primary.html)"
"What happens when there is exactly one primary bean among the candidates during autowiring?","When there is exactly one primary bean among the candidates during autowiring, it becomes the autowired value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-primary.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Qualifier annotation in Spring's autowiring by type?","The @Qualifier annotation is used to provide additional information to Spring's autowiring mechanism to select a specific bean among multiple candidates. It allows you to associate qualifier values with specific arguments, narrowing the set of type matches so that a specific bean is chosen for each argument. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)"
"Can you provide an example of how to use the @Qualifier annotation on individual constructor arguments or method parameters?","Yes, you can specify the @Qualifier annotation on individual constructor arguments or method parameters. Here is an example in Java: 

```java
public class MovieRecommender {
    private final MovieCatalog movieCatalog;
    private final CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

    @Autowired
    public void prepare(@Qualifier(""main"") MovieCatalog movieCatalog, CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
        this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog;
        this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
    }

    // ...
}
```

And in Kotlin: 

```kotlin
class MovieRecommender {
    private lateinit var movieCatalog: MovieCatalog
    private lateinit var customerPreferenceDao: CustomerPreferenceDao

    @Autowired
    fun prepare(@Qualifier(""main"") movieCatalog: MovieCatalog, customerPreferenceDao: CustomerPreferenceDao) {
        this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog
        this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao
    }

    // ...
}
```

In these examples, the @Qualifier annotation is used to specify that the `movieCatalog` argument should be autowired with the bean that has the qualifier value of ""main"". (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)"
"What is the difference between @Autowired and @Resource annotations in Spring?","The @Autowired annotation is used for type-driven injection with optional semantic qualifiers, while the @Resource annotation is semantically defined to identify a specific target component by its unique name, with the declared type being irrelevant for the matching process. @Autowired has different semantics: After selecting candidate beans by type, the specified String qualifier value is considered within those type-selected candidates only. In contrast, @Resource is supported only for fields and bean property setter methods with a single argument. As a consequence, you should stick with qualifiers if your injection target is a constructor or a multi-argument method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)"
"How can you use Java generic types as an implicit form of qualification in Spring Boot?","You can use Java generic types as an implicit form of qualification by implementing a generic interface, such as Store<String> and Store<Integer>, and then autowiring the Store interface with the generic as a qualifier. This allows you to inject specific beans based on the generic type."
"Can you autowire a generic List in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can autowire a generic List in Spring Boot. The generic type is used as a qualifier, and only beans with the matching generic type will be injected into the list. For example, if you autowire a List<Store<Integer>>, only Store beans with an <Integer> generic will be included in the list."
"How can you ensure that only specific Store beans are injected into a List in Spring Boot?","To ensure that only specific Store beans are injected into a List in Spring Boot, you can use the generic type as a qualifier when autowiring the List. For example, if you autowire a List<Store<Integer>>, only Store beans with an <Integer> generic will be included in the list."
"What is CustomAutowireConfigurer and what does it do?","CustomAutowireConfigurer is a BeanFactoryPostProcessor that allows you to register your own custom qualifier annotation types. It lets you register your custom qualifier annotations even if they are not annotated with Spring's @Qualifier annotation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/CustomAutowireConfigurer.html)"
"How can I use CustomAutowireConfigurer in my Spring application?","To use CustomAutowireConfigurer, you need to create a bean of type CustomAutowireConfigurer and set the customQualifierTypes property to a set of values representing your custom qualifier annotations. Here's an example: <bean id='customAutowireConfigurer' class='org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.CustomAutowireConfigurer'> <property name='customQualifierTypes'> <set> <value>example.CustomQualifier</value> </set> </property> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/custom-autowire-configurer.html)"
"How does the AutowireCandidateResolver determine autowire candidates?","The AutowireCandidateResolver determines autowire candidates by considering the autowire-candidate value of each bean definition, any default-autowire-candidates patterns available on the <beans/> element, the presence of @Qualifier annotations, and any custom annotations registered with the CustomAutowireConfigurer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/custom-autowire-configurer.html)"
"How can you inject a @Resource in Spring using the JSR-250 annotation?","You can inject a @Resource in Spring using the JSR-250 annotation by placing the @Resource annotation on fields or bean property setter methods. By default, Spring interprets the value of the name attribute as the bean name to be injected. If no name is explicitly specified, the default name is derived from the field name or setter method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/resource.html)"
"What is the default behavior of @Resource when no explicit name is specified?","When no explicit name is specified with the @Resource annotation, the default behavior is to derive the name from the field name or setter method. In case of a field, it takes the field name. In case of a setter method, it takes the bean property name. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/resource.html)"
"Can you explain how @Resource resolves known resolvable dependencies in Spring?","Yes, @Resource can resolve known resolvable dependencies in Spring. In the exclusive case of @Resource usage with no explicit name specified, it looks for a bean named after the field or setter method and then falls back to a primary type match for the type. It can resolve well-known resolvable dependencies such as BeanFactory, ApplicationContext, ResourceLoader, ApplicationEventPublisher, and MessageSource interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/resource.html)"

"Can you provide an example of how to use a default value with the @Value annotation?","Yes, you can provide a default value as following: @Component public class MovieRecommender { private final String catalog; public MovieRecommender(@Value(""${catalog.name:defaultCatalog}"") String catalog) { this.catalog = catalog; } }. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/value-annotations.html)"
"What are the JSR-250 lifecycle annotations supported by the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in Spring?","The JSR-250 lifecycle annotations supported by the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in Spring are: jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct and jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.html)"
"How does the support for @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations in Spring offer an alternative to the lifecycle callback mechanism described in initialization and destruction callbacks?","The support for @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations in Spring offers an alternative to the lifecycle callback mechanism described in initialization and destruction callbacks by invoking a method carrying one of these annotations at the same point in the lifecycle as the corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or explicitly declared callback method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.html)"
"What happens when the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is registered within the Spring ApplicationContext and a method carries the @PostConstruct annotation?","When the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is registered within the Spring ApplicationContext and a method carries the @PostConstruct annotation, the method is invoked upon initialization at the same point in the lifecycle as the corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or explicitly declared callback method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of classpath scanning in Spring Boot?","Classpath scanning is used to implicitly detect candidate components by scanning the classpath.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/basic-concepts.html)"
"What is the role of the @Bean annotation in Spring's Java configuration support?","The @Bean annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. For those familiar with Spring’s <beans/> XML configuration, the @Bean annotation plays the same role as the <bean/> element. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/basic-concepts.html)"
"What is the difference between @Bean methods declared within @Configuration classes and those declared within classes that are not annotated with @Configuration?","When @Bean methods are declared within @Configuration classes, they are processed in a full mode, ensuring that full configuration class processing applies and that cross-method references therefore get redirected to the container’s lifecycle management. When @Bean methods are declared within classes that are not annotated with @Configuration, they are referred to as being processed in a 'lite' mode, and they are effectively a general-purpose factory method mechanism without special runtime processing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/basic-concepts.html)"
"What is the purpose of the AnnotationConfigApplicationContext in Spring?","The AnnotationConfigApplicationContext is a versatile ApplicationContext implementation introduced in Spring 3.0 that is capable of accepting not only @Configuration classes as input but also plain @Component classes and classes annotated with JSR-330 metadata. It allows for completely XML-free usage of the Spring container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/instantiating-container.html)"

"How can you register a BeanPostProcessor with a DefaultListableBeanFactory?","To register a BeanPostProcessor with a DefaultListableBeanFactory, you need to programmatically call the addBeanPostProcessor method. The following example shows how to do this in Java and Kotlin: Java: DefaultListableBeanFactory factory = new DefaultListableBeanFactory(); // populate the factory with bean definitions // now register any needed BeanPostProcessor instances factory.addBeanPostProcessor(new AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor()); factory.addBeanPostProcessor(new MyBeanPostProcessor()); // now start using the factory Kotlin: val factory = DefaultListableBeanFactory() // populate the factory with bean definitions // now register any needed BeanPostProcessor instances factory.addBeanPostProcessor(AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor()) factory.addBeanPostProcessor(MyBeanPostProcessor()) // now start using the factory (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/beanfactory.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's Resource interface?","Spring's Resource interface located in the org.springframework.core.io. package is meant to be a more capable interface for abstracting access to low-level resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/resources.html)"
"What are some built-in Resource implementations in Spring?","Spring includes several built-in Resource implementations such as UrlResource, ClassPathResource, FileSystemResource, PathResource, ServletContextResource, InputStreamResource, and ByteArrayResource. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/resources.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ResourceLoader interface in Spring?","The ResourceLoader interface is meant to be implemented by objects that can return (that is, load) Resource instances. All application contexts implement the ResourceLoader interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/resources.html)"
"Why is it important for validation to not be tied to the web tier?","It is important for validation to not be tied to the web tier because validation should be easy to localize and it should be possible to plug in any available validator. This allows for flexibility and adaptability in different layers of an application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Validator contract provided by Spring?","The Validator contract provided by Spring is both basic and eminently usable in every layer of an application. It allows for validation that is not tied to the web tier and is easy to localize, and it allows for plugging in any available validator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the DataBinder in Spring?","The DataBinder in Spring is used for letting user input be dynamically bound to the domain model of an application (or whatever objects you use to process user input). It is part of the validation package and is primarily used in but not limited to the web layer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Validator interface in Spring?","The Validator interface in Spring is used to validate objects. It works by using an Errors object so that, while validating, validators can report validation failures to the Errors object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/validator.html)"
"How can you implement a Validator for a specific class in Spring?","To implement a Validator for a specific class in Spring, you need to implement the following two methods of the org.springframework.validation.Validator interface: supports(Class) and validate(Object, org.springframework.validation.Errors). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/validator.html)"
"How can you reuse validation logic in Spring using a Validator?","You can reuse validation logic in Spring using a Validator by encapsulating the validation logic for each nested class of object in its own Validator implementation and dependency-injecting or instantiating the relevant Validator within your main Validator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/validator.html)"
"What is data binding in Spring and how does it work?","Data binding in Spring is a process of binding user input to a target object. It works by using the DataBinder class, which provides two ways to bind user input: constructor binding and property binding. Constructor binding binds user input to a public data constructor, while property binding binds user input to setters. The target class should have a single public or non-public constructor with arguments. Type conversion is applied as needed to convert user input. If the constructor parameter is an object, it is constructed recursively in the same manner, but through a nested property path. Binding and conversion errors are reflected in the BindingResult of the DataBinder. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html>)"
"What is the BeanWrapper class in Spring and what does it do?","The BeanWrapper class in Spring adheres to the JavaBeans standard and offers functionality to set and get property values, get property descriptors, and query properties to determine if they are readable or writable. It also supports nested properties, enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth. The BeanWrapper usually is not used by application code directly but is used by the DataBinder and the BeanFactory. The way the BeanWrapper works is partly indicated by its name: it wraps a bean to perform actions on that bean, such as setting and retrieving properties. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html>)"
"What are PropertyEditors in Spring and how are they used?","PropertyEditors in Spring are used to effect the conversion between an Object and a String. They can be handy to represent properties in a different way than the object itself. Spring uses the concept of a PropertyEditor to convert properties to the desired type. PropertyEditors are registered on a BeanWrapper or in a specific IoC container. Spring has a number of built-in PropertyEditor implementations to make life easy. They are all located in the org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors package. Most, (but not all) are, by default, registered by BeanWrapperImpl. PropertyEditors can be registered manually for custom types or to override the default behavior. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html>)"
"How does Spring Framework handle the registration of error codes during validation?","Spring Framework uses a MessageCodesResolver to determine which error codes the Errors interface registers. By default, the DefaultMessageCodesResolver is used, which registers the code you provided and additional error codes that include the field name and type. This is done for convenience when targeting error messages. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/MessageCodesResolver.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the rejectValue method in Spring Framework's Errors interface?","The rejectValue method is used to reject a field during validation and register the provided error code. Additionally, the DefaultMessageCodesResolver registers additional error codes that include the field name and type for convenience when targeting error messages. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/conversion.html>)"
"How can developers use the MessageSource to output validation error messages in Spring Framework?","Developers can use the error code provided when rejecting a field during validation to output the corresponding error message using the MessageSource. The DefaultMessageCodesResolver registers additional error codes that include the field name and type, making it easier to target error messages. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/conversion.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring Type Conversion system?","The purpose of the Spring Type Conversion system is to provide a general type conversion system that defines an SPI to implement type conversion logic and an API to perform type conversions at runtime. It can be used as an alternative to PropertyEditor implementations to convert externalized bean property value strings to the required property types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/convert.html)"
"How do you implement a custom converter in Spring Type Conversion?","To create your own converter, you need to implement the Converter interface and parameterize S as the type you are converting from and T as the type you are converting to. You can also transparently apply such a converter if a collection or array of S needs to be converted to an array or collection of T, provided that a delegating array or collection converter has been registered as well. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/convert.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ConverterFactory interface in Spring Type Conversion?","The ConverterFactory interface is used when you need to centralize the conversion logic for an entire class hierarchy. You can implement ConverterFactory to define a base type defining the range of classes you can convert to and then implement getConverter(Class<T>) where T is a subclass of R.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/format.html)"
"How can I create my own Formatter implementation in Spring Framework?","To create your own Formatter implementation in Spring Framework, you need to implement the Formatter interface, which extends from the Printer and Parser building-block interfaces. Implement the print() operation to print an instance of T for display in the client locale, and implement the parse() operation to parse an instance of T from the formatted representation returned from the client locale. Your Formatter should throw a ParseException or an IllegalArgumentException if a parse attempt fails. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/format.html)"
"What is the difference between the Converter SPI and the Formatter SPI in Spring Framework?","The Converter SPI is used to implement general-purpose type conversion logic, such as converting between a java.util.Date and a Long. On the other hand, the Formatter SPI is designed to handle the type conversion requirements of typical client environments, such as web or desktop applications, which often involve converting from String to support the client postback process and back to String to support the view rendering process. Additionally, the Formatter SPI is used to localize String values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/format.html)"
"What is Java Bean Validation and how does Spring Framework support it?","Java Bean Validation is a framework that provides a common way of validation through constraint declaration and metadata for Java applications. The Spring Framework provides full support for the Java Bean Validation API, including the bootstrapping of a Bean Validation provider as a Spring bean. This allows you to inject a jakarta.validation.ValidatorFactory or jakarta.validation.Validator wherever validation is needed in your application."
"How can you declare constraints using Bean Validation?","Constraints can be declared by annotating domain model properties with declarative validation constraints. These constraints are then enforced by the runtime. There are built-in constraints, and you can also define your own custom constraints. For example, you can use annotations like @NotNull, @Size, and @Min to declare constraints on a property."
"How can you configure a Bean Validation provider as a Spring bean?","You can use the LocalValidatorFactoryBean to configure a default Validator as a Spring bean. The basic configuration triggers bean validation to initialize by using its default bootstrap mechanism. A Bean Validation provider, such as the Hibernate Validator, is expected to be present in the classpath and is automatically detected. You can inject a reference to the jakarta.validation.Validator or the org.springframework.validation.Validator as needed."
"What is the purpose of the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) in the Spring portfolio?","The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions.html)"
"How is the SpEL language syntax similar to Jakarta Expression Language?","The SpEL language syntax is similar to the Jakarta Expression Language, but it offers additional features, most notably method invocation and basic string templating functionality. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions.html)"
"Can SpEL be used independently of Spring?","Yes, while SpEL serves as the foundation for expression evaluation within the Spring portfolio, it is not directly tied to Spring and can be used independently. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ExpressionParser interface in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and what does it do?","The ExpressionParser interface in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is responsible for parsing an expression string. It takes an expression string as input and returns an Expression object that can be used to evaluate the expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/evaluation.html)"
"What are the two types of exceptions that can be thrown when calling parser.parseExpression(…​) and exp.getValue(…​) in SpEL?","The two types of exceptions that can be thrown when calling parser.parseExpression(…​) and exp.getValue(…​) in SpEL are ParseException and EvaluationException, respectively. A ParseException is thrown when there is a problem parsing the expression string, while an EvaluationException is thrown when there is a problem evaluating the expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/evaluation.html)"
"What is the difference between SimpleEvaluationContext and StandardEvaluationContext in SpEL?","SimpleEvaluationContext is designed to support only a subset of the SpEL language syntax, while StandardEvaluationContext provides the full set of SpEL language features and configuration options. SimpleEvaluationContext is useful for categories of expressions that do not require the full extent of the SpEL language syntax and should be meaningfully restricted, such as data binding expressions and property-based filters. StandardEvaluationContext can be used to specify a default root object and to configure every available evaluation-related strategy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/evaluation.html)"
"What is the Spring Expression Language and where can I find more information about it?","The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that can be used within Spring applications. You can find more information about it in the Language Reference section of the Spring Framework reference guide, which is available at <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref.html>."
"How do you create an inline list using the Spring Expression Language?","To create an inline list using the Spring Expression Language, you can use the following syntax: {element1, element2, ..., elementN}. For example, to create a list with the elements 'a', 'b', and 'c', you would use the expression: {a, b, c}. You can find more information about this in the Inline Lists section of the Language Reference, available at <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>."
"How do you access a property of a bean using the Spring Expression Language?","To access a property of a bean using the Spring Expression Language, you can use the following syntax: beanName.propertyName. For example, to access the property 'name' of a bean named 'myBean', you would use the expression: myBean.name. You can find more information about this in the Bean References section of the Language Reference, available at <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/bean-references.html>."
"How are strings represented in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) literal expressions?","In Spring Expression Language (SpEL), strings can be represented using single quotation marks (' ') or double quotation marks ("" ""). To include a single quotation mark within a string enclosed in single quotation marks, use two adjacent single quotation mark characters. Similarly, to include a double quotation mark within a string enclosed in double quotation marks, use two adjacent double quotation mark characters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/literal.html)"
"How are literal numbers represented in SpEL, and what are the supported types?","Literal numbers in SpEL can be represented as integers, longs, hexadecimals, floats, and doubles. By default, real numbers are parsed using Double.parseDouble(). Due to the design and implementation of SpEL, literal numbers are always stored internally as positive numbers. For example, -2 is stored internally as a positive 2 which is then negated while evaluating the expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/literal.html)"
"How can you represent the minimum value for a particular type of number within a SpEL expression?","To represent the minimum value for a particular type of number within a SpEL expression, you can either reference the MIN_VALUE constant for the respective wrapper type (such as Integer.MIN_VALUE, Long.MIN_VALUE, etc.) or calculate the minimum value. For example, to use the minimum integer value, you can use T(Integer).MIN_VALUE (requiring a StandardEvaluationContext) or -2^31 (which can be used with any type of EvaluationContext). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/literal.html)"
"How can you represent lists in an expression using Spring Expression Language?","You can directly express lists in an expression by using {} notation. For example, List numbers = (List) parser.parseExpression(""{1,2,3,4}"").getValue(context); (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>)"
"What does {} mean when used by itself in Spring Expression Language?","{} by itself means an empty list. For performance reasons, if the list is itself entirely composed of fixed literals, a constant list is created to represent the expression (rather than building a new list on each evaluation). (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>)"
"How can you represent a list of lists in an expression using Spring Expression Language?","You can represent a list of lists in an expression by using nested {} notation.

"What is the syntax for directly expressing maps in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and how can you create a map with fixed literals?","In Spring Expression Language (SpEL), you can directly express maps using {key:value} notation. To create a map with fixed literals, you can use constant structures like lists or maps. For example: {name:'Nikola',dob:'10-July-1856'}. For performance reasons, a constant map is created to represent the expression, which is more efficient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-maps.html)"
"Can you use quoted keys when expressing maps in SpEL, and when is quoting necessary?","Quoting of the map keys is optional in SpEL, unless the key contains a period (.). If the key does not contain a period, you can use unquoted keys. For example: {name:'Nikola',dob:'10-July-1856'}. In the provided examples, the keys are not quoted.

"What is the difference between around advice and before advice in Spring Boot?","Around advice runs 'around' a matched method’s execution and has the opportunity to do work both before and after the method runs and to determine when, how, and even if the method actually gets to run at all. Before advice, on the other hand, runs before a matched method execution. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/advice.html>)"
"What are introductions in AspectJ and how do they work?","Introductions, also known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ, enable an aspect to declare that advised objects implement a given interface and provide an implementation of that interface on behalf of those objects. This is done using the @DeclareParents annotation, which is used to declare that matching types have a new parent. For example, given an interface named UsageTracked and an implementation of that interface named DefaultUsageTracked, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service interfaces also implement the UsageTracked interface: Java Kotlin @Aspect public class UsageTracking { @DeclareParents(value=""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl=DefaultUsageTracked.class) public static UsageTracked mixin; @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") public void recordUsage(UsageTracked usageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount(); } } @Aspect class UsageTracking { companion object { @DeclareParents(value = ""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl = DefaultUsageTracked::class) lateinit var mixin: UsageTracked } @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") fun recordUsage(usageTracked: UsageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount() } } (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/introductions.html})"
"How can I make an introduction using the @DeclareParents annotation?","To make an introduction using the @DeclareParents annotation, you need to annotate a field in your aspect class. The type of the annotated field determines the interface to be implemented. The value attribute of the @DeclareParents annotation is an AspectJ type pattern. Any bean of a matching type implements the UsageTracked interface. For example, given an interface named UsageTracked and an implementation of that interface named DefaultUsageTracked, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service interfaces also implement the UsageTracked interface: Java Kotlin @Aspect public class UsageTracking { @DeclareParents(value=""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl=DefaultUsageTracked.class) public static UsageTracked mixin; @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") public void recordUsage(UsageTracked usageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount(); } } @Aspect class UsageTracking { companion object { @DeclareParents(value = ""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl = DefaultUsageTracked::class) lateinit var mixin: UsageTracked } @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") fun recordUsage(usageTracked: UsageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount() } } (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/introductions.html})"
"How can I access a bean programmatically if it implements an interface introduced by an aspect?","If a bean implements an interface introduced by an aspect, you can access it programmatically by using the following code: Java Kotlin UsageTracked usageTracked = context.getBean(""myService"", UsageTracked.class); val usageTracked = context.getBean(""myService"", UsageTracked.class) This code retrieves the bean with the name ""myService"" and casts it to the UsageTracked interface.

"How does the pertarget instantiation model work compared to perthis?","The pertarget instantiation model works in the same way as perthis, but creates one aspect instance for each unique target object at matched join points. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/instantiation-models.html)"
"What is the purpose of the aspect implementation in the given example?","The purpose of the aspect implementation is to transparently retry a business service operation if it fails due to concurrency issues, such as a deadlock loser. This is achieved using around advice to call proceed multiple times. The aspect is implemented with the Ordered interface to set its precedence higher than the transaction advice, and the maxRetries and order properties are configured by Spring. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/example.html)"
"How does the aspect implementation determine when to retry a business service operation?","The aspect implementation determines when to retry a business service operation by catching a PessimisticLockingFailureException and incrementing a retry counter. It continues to retry the operation until it has been attempted maxRetries times. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/example.html)"
"How can the aspect implementation be refined to only retry idempotent operations?","The aspect implementation can be refined to only retry idempotent operations by defining an Idempotent annotation and using it to annotate the implementation of service operations. The pointcut expression in the aspect can then be refined to only match @Idempotent operations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/example.html)"
"What is the purpose of using the aop namespace tags in Spring?","The aop namespace tags in Spring are used to define aspects and provide support for schema-based AOP configuration. They allow you to define pointcuts, advisors, and aspects within an <aop:config> element, and use the same pointcut expressions and advice kinds as in the @AspectJ style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/schema.html)"
"How do you declare an aspect using the schema-based AOP support in Spring?","To declare an aspect using the schema-based AOP support in Spring, you use the <aop:aspect> element and reference the backing bean using the ref attribute. The bean that backs the aspect must be configured and dependency injected just like any other Spring bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/schema.html)"
"What is the difference between declaring a pointcut inside an aspect and declaring a top-level pointcut in Spring's schema-based AOP support?","Declaring a pointcut inside an aspect is similar to declaring a top-level pointcut, but pointcuts defined in this way are referred to by their XML id and cannot be used as named pointcuts to form composite pointcuts. The named pointcut support in the schema-based definition style is more limited than that offered by the @AspectJ style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/schema.html)"
"What are some factors to consider when deciding between using Spring AOP or AspectJ?","The factors to consider when deciding between using Spring AOP or AspectJ include application requirements, development tools, and team familiarity with AOP. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/choosing.html)"
"When should you use Spring AOP over AspectJ?","You should use Spring AOP over AspectJ when you only need to advise the execution of operations on Spring beans and when you want to avoid introducing the AspectJ compiler/weaver into your development and build processes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/choosing.html)"
"What are the advantages of using the @AspectJ style over the XML style for Spring AOP?","The advantages of using the @AspectJ style over the XML style for Spring AOP include better encapsulation of the aspect implementation, richer pointcut composition, and the ability to be understood and consumed by both Spring AOP and AspectJ. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/choosing.html)"
"Is it possible to combine different aspect types in a Spring AOP configuration?","Yes, it is possible to mix @AspectJ style aspects, schema-defined <aop:aspect> aspects, <aop:advisor> declared advisors, and even proxies and interceptors in other styles in the same configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/mixing-styles.html)"
"How are the different aspect types in a Spring AOP configuration implemented?","All of these aspect types are implemented using the same underlying support mechanism. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/mixing-styles.html)"
"Can different aspect types co-exist in a Spring AOP configuration without any issues?","Yes, all of these aspect types can co-exist without any difficulty. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/mixing-styles.html)"
"What are the two proxying mechanisms used by Spring AOP?","JDK dynamic proxies and CGLIB (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/proxying.html)"
"When is a JDK dynamic proxy used instead of a CGLIB proxy?","If the target object to be proxied implements at least one interface, a JDK dynamic proxy is used. If the target object does not implement any interfaces, a CGLIB proxy is created. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/proxying.html)"
"What are the limitations of using CGLIB proxies in Spring AOP?","Final methods cannot be advised with CGLIB proxies, as they cannot be overridden in runtime-generated subclasses. Additionally, there may be limitations with the JDK 9+ platform module system, and the JVM may not allow for constructor bypassing, leading to double invocations and corresponding debug log entries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/proxying.html)"
"How can I programmatically create @AspectJ proxies in Spring Boot?","You can use the org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.AspectJProxyFactory class to create a proxy for a target object that is advised by one or more @AspectJ aspects. The basic usage for this class is very simple, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin // create a factory that can generate a proxy for the given target object AspectJProxyFactory factory = new AspectJProxyFactory(targetObject); // add an aspect, the class must be an @AspectJ aspect // you can call this as many times as you need with different aspects factory.addAspect(SecurityManager.class); // you can also add existing aspect instances, the type of the object supplied // must be an @AspectJ aspect factory.addAspect(usageTracker); // now get the proxy object... MyInterfaceType proxy = factory.getProxy(); // create a factory that can generate a proxy for the given target object val factory = AspectJProxyFactory(targetObject) // add an aspect, the class must be an @AspectJ aspect // you can call this as many times as you need with different aspects factory.addAspect(SecurityManager::class.java) // you can also add existing aspect instances, the type of the object supplied // must be an @AspectJ aspect factory.addAspect(usageTracker) // now get the proxy object... val proxy = factory.getProxy<Any>() See the javadoc(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/aspectj/annotation/AspectJProxyFactory.html) for more information.(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/aspectj-programmatic.html)"

"What is the purpose of the AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect in spring-aspects.jar?","The AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect in spring-aspects.jar is used to implement the @Configurable support, which allows dependency injection of any object, including domain objects created outside of the control of any container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/using-aspectj.html)"
"How can you configure AspectJ aspects with Spring?","To configure AspectJ aspects with Spring, you can create a bean definition that references the aspect type as normal and include the factory-method='aspectOf' bean attribute. This ensures that Spring obtains the aspect instance by asking AspectJ for it rather than trying to create an instance itself. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/using-aspectj.html)"
"What is the purpose of the META-INF/aop.xml file in AspectJ load-time weaving (LTW)?","The META-INF/aop.xml file is used to inform the AspectJ weaver about which aspects to weave into the classes in your application. It is a standard AspectJ convention and is required for LTW. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/using-aspectj.html)"
"Where can I find more information on AspectJ?","You can find more information on AspectJ on the AspectJ website(https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj)."
"What book provides a comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language?","Eclipse AspectJ by Adrian Colyer et. al. (Addison-Wesley, 2005) provides a comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language."
"Which book is highly recommended for learning about AspectJ and general AOP themes?","AspectJ in Action , Second Edition by Ramnivas Laddad (Manning, 2009) comes highly recommended. The focus of the book is on AspectJ, but a lot of general AOP themes are explored (in some depth)."
"What are the three main APIs discussed in the Spring AOP chapter?","The three main APIs discussed in the Spring AOP chapter are the Pointcut API, Advice API, and Advisor API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api.html)"
"Which class is used to create AOP proxies programmatically?","The ProxyFactory class is used to create AOP proxies programmatically. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api.html)"
"What is the recommended approach for using Spring AOP?","The recommended approach for using Spring AOP is to use Spring AOP with AspectJ pointcuts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api.html)"
"What is the central interface used to target advice to particular classes and methods in Spring's pointcut model?","The central interface used to target advice to particular classes and methods in Spring's pointcut model is the org.springframework.aop.Pointcut interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pointcuts.html)"
"What does the ClassFilter interface in Spring's Pointcut interface do?","The ClassFilter interface in Spring's Pointcut interface is used to restrict the pointcut to a given set of target classes. If the matches() method always returns true, all target classes are matched. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pointcuts.html)"
"What is the main type of pointcut used by Spring since 2.0?","The main type of pointcut used by Spring since 2.0 is the org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJExpressionPointcut, which uses an AspectJ-supplied library to parse an AspectJ pointcut expression string. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pointcuts.html)"
"What is the main advantage of a before advice in Spring AOP?","The main advantage of a before advice is that there is no need to invoke the proceed() method and, therefore, no possibility of inadvertently failing to proceed down the interceptor chain. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advice.html)"
"How can you add a check in the invoke() method of a LockMixin class to prevent setter methods from being invoked when in locked mode?","In the LockMixin class, you can add a check in the invoke() method to prevent setter methods from being invoked when in locked mode by using the following code: if (locked() && invocation.getMethod().getName().indexOf('set') == 0) { throw new LockedException(); } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advice.html)"
"What is the difference between per-class and per-instance advice in Spring AOP?","Per-class advice is used most often and is appropriate for generic advice, such as transaction advisors. These do not depend on the state of the proxied object or add new state. They merely act on the method and arguments. Per-instance advice, on the other hand, is appropriate for introductions, to support mixins. In this case, the advice adds state to the proxied object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advice.html)"
"What is an Advisor in Spring?","An Advisor in Spring is an aspect that contains a single advice object associated with a pointcut expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advisor.html)"
"What is the most commonly used advisor class in Spring?","The most commonly used advisor class in Spring is org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advisor.html)"
"Is it possible to mix advisor and advice types in Spring?","Yes, it is possible to mix advisor and advice types in Spring in the same AOP proxy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advisor.html)"
"How can I use ProxyFactoryBean to create an AOP proxy in Spring?","To create an AOP proxy in Spring using ProxyFactoryBean, you need to define a ProxyFactoryBean named foo and use it to create an AOP proxy that wraps a target object. This allows advice and pointcuts to be managed by IoC, providing a powerful feature that is hard to achieve with other AOP frameworks. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pfb.html)"
"What is the difference between JDK-based and CGLIB-based proxies in Spring?","JDK-based proxies are interface-based and can only be used if the target class implements one or more interfaces. CGLIB-based proxies, on the other hand, can be used with any target class, including classes that do not implement any interfaces. The ProxyFactoryBean automatically detects the type of proxy to create based on the target class and the configuration of the bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pfb.html)"
"How can I use ProxyFactoryBean to advice a class that does not implement any interfaces?","To advice a class that does not implement any interfaces, you can set the proxyTargetClass property on the ProxyFactoryBean to true, which will force Spring to use CGLIB proxying. CGLIB proxying works by generating a subclass of the target class at runtime, which can then be used to implement the Decorator pattern and weave in the advice. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pfb.html)"
"What is the purpose of creating a parent, template bean definition for a proxy in Spring?","The purpose of creating a parent, template bean definition for a proxy in Spring is to define a reusable and concise proxy definition that can be used as a base for multiple proxy definitions. This allows for cleaner and more efficient proxy configurations, especially when dealing with transactional proxies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/concise-proxy.html)"
"What is the advantage of using parent and child bean definitions for proxy definitions in Spring?","Using parent and child bean definitions for proxy definitions in Spring offers several advantages. It allows for the reuse of common proxy properties, reduces redundancy in proxy definitions, and makes it easier to manage and maintain proxy configurations. By using a parent bean definition as a template, you can define a set of default proxy properties that can be overridden or extended in child bean definitions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/concise-proxy.html)"
"How can you override properties from a parent template bean definition in Spring?","To override properties from a parent template bean definition in Spring, you can use the property element within the child bean definition. For example, in the case of transactional proxies, you can override the transaction propagation settings by specifying the transactionAttributes property within the child bean definition. This allows you to customize the proxy properties for each individual proxy without modifying the parent template. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/concise-proxy.html)"
"How can you create AOP proxies programmatically in Spring without relying on Spring IoC?","You can create AOP proxies programmatically with Spring by using the ProxyFactory class. The interfaces implemented by the target object are automatically proxied. The first step is to construct an object of type org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory. You can add advice, advisors, or both and manipulate them for the life of the ProxyFactory. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/prog.html)"
"What is the advantage of integrating AOP proxy creation with the IoC framework in Spring applications?","Integrating AOP proxy creation with the IoC framework is best practice in most Spring applications. It is recommended to externalize configuration from Java code with AOP, as you should in general. This practice helps to separate concerns and improve the maintainability and scalability of your application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/prog.html)"
"Can you add additional interfaces to the proxy using the ProxyFactory in Spring AOP?","Yes, you can add additional interfaces to the proxy using the ProxyFactory in Spring AOP by adding an IntroductionInterceptionAroundAdvisor. This will cause the proxy to implement additional interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/prog.html)"
"How can you manipulate AOP proxies in Spring Boot?","You can manipulate AOP proxies in Spring Boot by using the org.springframework.aop.framework.Advised interface. Any AOP proxy can be cast to this interface, no matter which other interfaces it implements. This interface includes various methods such as getAdvisors(), addAdvice(), addAdvisor(), indexOf(), removeAdvisor(), replaceAdvisor(), and isFrozen(). The getAdvisors() method returns an Advisor for every advisor, interceptor, or other advice type that has been added to the factory. The addAdvisor() methods can be used to add any Advisor. By default, it is possible to add or remove advisors or interceptors even once a proxy has been created, unless the proxy has been frozen."
"What is the role of the Advised interface in Spring Boot AOP?","The Advised interface in Spring Boot AOP plays a crucial role in manipulating AOP proxies. It provides various methods to interact with the proxies, such as retrieving the advisors, adding or removing advice, and checking if the proxy is frozen. This interface allows developers to examine and modify the advice on a business object, which can be particularly useful in development, for example, in tests when adding test code in the form of an interceptor or other advice."
"How can you add selective advice using a pointcut in Spring Boot AOP?","To add selective advice using a pointcut in Spring Boot AOP, you can use the addAdvisor() methods provided by the Advised interface. These methods can be used to add any Advisor. Usually, the advisor holding pointcut and advice is the generic DefaultPointcutAdvisor, which you can use with any advice or pointcut (but not for introductions). By default, it is possible to add or remove advisors or interceptors even once a proxy has been created. The following example demonstrates how to add selective advice using a pointcut: advised.addAdvisor(new DefaultPointcutAdvisor(mySpecialPointcut, myAdvice));"
"What is the purpose of the auto-proxy facility in Spring?","The auto-proxy facility in Spring allows for the automatic creation of AOP proxies for selected bean definitions. It is built on Spring's 'bean post processor' infrastructure, which enables modification of any bean definition as the container loads. This facility is useful for applying the same configuration consistently to multiple objects with minimal volume of configuration. It is a popular choice for applying declarative transactions to multiple objects. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/autoproxy.html)"
"What is the difference between BeanNameAutoProxyCreator and DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator?","BeanNameAutoProxyCreator is a BeanPostProcessor that automatically creates AOP proxies for beans with names that match literal values or wildcards. It requires specifying the bean names in the auto-proxy creator's bean definition. On the other hand, DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator automatically applies eligible advisors in the current context without the need to include specific bean names. It is more general and powerful, as it can apply any number of advisors to each business object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/autoproxy.html)"
"How does DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator evaluate which advice to apply to each business object?","DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator automatically evaluates the pointcut contained in each advisor to see what (if any) advice it should apply to each business object. This means that any number of advisors can be applied automatically to each business object. If no pointcut in any of the advisors matches any method in a business object, the object is not proxied. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/autoproxy.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TargetSource interface in Spring AOP?","The TargetSource interface in Spring AOP is responsible for returning the ‘target object’ that implements the join point. It is asked for a target instance each time the AOP proxy handles a method invocation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/targetsource.html)"
"What is the difference between a pooling TargetSource and a prototype TargetSource in Spring AOP?","A pooling TargetSource maintains a pool of identical instances, while a prototype TargetSource creates a new instance of the target on every method invocation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/targetsource.html)"
"How can you change the target of a HotSwappableTargetSource in Spring AOP?","You can change the target of a HotSwappableTargetSource by using the swap() method on HotSwappableTargetSource. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/targetsource.html)"
"How can new advice types be supported in Spring AOP without modifying the core framework?","Spring AOP's extensibility allows for the addition of new custom advice types without changing the core framework. This is achieved through the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter SPI package. The only requirement for a custom Advice type is that it must implement the org.aopalliance.aop.Advice marker interface. For more information, refer to the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter javadoc (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/extensibility.html)"
"What is the constraint for implementing a custom Advice type in Spring AOP?","For a custom Advice type to be implemented in Spring AOP, it must implement the org.aopalliance.aop.Advice marker interface. This is the only constraint. For further information, refer to the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter javadoc (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/extensibility.html)"
"What is the role of the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter package in Spring AOP?","The org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter package in Spring AOP is a Service Provider Interface (SPI) package that enables support for new custom advice types without altering the core framework. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of arbitrary advice types in addition to the existing interception around, before, throws, and after returning advice. For more information, refer to the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter javadoc (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/extensibility.html)"
"What are the Spring Framework's annotations for declaring nullability of APIs and fields?","The Spring Framework provides the following annotations in the org.springframework.lang package to declare nullability of APIs and fields: @Nullable, @NonNull, @NonNullApi, and @NonNullFields. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @NonNullApi and @NonNullFields annotations?","The @NonNullApi and @NonNullFields annotations are used to declare non-null as the default semantics for parameters, return values, and fields, respectively. They can be used at the package level to make the entire package null-safe. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html)"
"How do I use the Spring Framework's null-safety annotations in my project?","To use the Spring Framework's null-safety annotations in your project, you can add the relevant annotations to your API and field declarations. For example, you can use @Nullable to indicate that a specific parameter, return value, or field can be null, and @NonNull to indicate that a specific parameter, return value, or field cannot be null. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html)"
"What are the main benefits of using DataBuffer over java.nio.ByteBuffer?","The DataBuffer interface offers similar operations as java.nio.ByteBuffer but also brings a few additional benefits some of which are inspired by the Netty ByteBuf. Some of these benefits include read and write with independent positions, capacity expanded on demand, pooled buffers and reference counting via PooledDataBuffer, and the ability to view a buffer as java.nio.ByteBuffer, InputStream, or OutputStream. It also offers methods to determine the index or the last index for a given byte. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/databuffer-codec.html)"
"What is the role of DataBufferFactory and how is it used in WebFlux applications?","DataBufferFactory is used to create data buffers in one of two ways: Allocate a new data buffer, optionally specifying capacity upfront, which is more efficient even though implementations of DataBuffer can grow and shrink on demand. Wrap an existing byte[] or java.nio.ByteBuffer, which decorates the given data with a DataBuffer implementation and that does not involve allocation. Note that WebFlux applications do not create a DataBufferFactory directly but instead access it through the ServerHttpResponse or the ClientHttpRequest on the client side. The type of factory depends on the underlying client or server, e.g. NettyDataBufferFactory for Reactor Netty, DefaultDataBufferFactory for others. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/databuffer-codec.html)"
"What is the purpose of Codecs in Spring Framework and what are the different types of codecs provided?","Codecs in Spring Framework are used to decode or encode data buffer streams into higher level objects. The org.springframework.core.codec package provides the following strategy interfaces: Encoder to encode Publisher<T> into a stream of data buffers, and Decoder to decode Publisher<DataBuffer> into a stream of higher level objects. The spring-core module provides byte[], ByteBuffer, DataBuffer, Resource, and String encoder and decoder implementations. The spring-web module adds Jackson JSON, Jackson Smile, JAXB2, Protocol Buffers and other encoders and decoders.

"What logging implementation does Spring Boot use by default since version 5.0?","Spring Boot uses Commons Logging bridge implemented in the spring-jcl module by default since version 5.0. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/spring-jcl.html)"
"How does Spring Boot determine which logging implementation to use?","Spring Boot checks for the presence of Log4j 2.x API and SLF4J 1.7 API in the classpath and uses the first one found as the logging implementation, falling back to Java platform's core logging facilities (JUL) if neither is available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/spring-jcl.html)"
"What are the recommended logging implementations for application code within Spring Boot?","For logging needs within application code, Spring Boot recommends direct use of Log4j 2.x, SLF4J, or JUL. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/spring-jcl.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's support for AOT optimizations?","Spring's support for Ahead of Time (AOT) optimizations is meant to inspect an ApplicationContext at build time and apply decisions and discovery logic that usually happens at runtime. This allows building an application startup arrangement that is more straightforward and focused on a fixed set of features based mainly on the classpath and the Environment. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html)"
"What restrictions apply when using Spring's AOT optimizations?","When using Spring's AOT optimizations, the following restrictions apply: The classpath is fixed and fully defined at build time, the beans defined in your application cannot change at runtime, @Profile-specific configuration needs to be chosen at build time, environment properties that impact the presence of a bean are only considered at build time, bean definitions with instance suppliers cannot be transformed ahead-of-time, and beans registered as singletons cannot be transformed ahead-of-time. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html)"
"How does the AOT engine process a Spring application?","The AOT engine for processing a Spring ApplicationContext starts with ApplicationContextAotGenerator, which takes care of refreshing an ApplicationContext for AOT processing, invoking available BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor implementations, and applying their contributions against the GenerationContext. This process updates the GenerationContext with the generated code, resources, and classes necessary for the application to run. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html)"
"What is the purpose of XML schemas in the context of Spring Boot?","XML schemas provide a way to define and validate the structure of XML documents. In Spring Boot, XML schemas are used to define the structure of configuration files, such as those used for setting up beans and dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix.html#xsd-schemas)"
"How can you create custom XML schemas for use in Spring Boot applications?","To create custom XML schemas for use in Spring Boot applications, you can use the XML Schema Definition (XSD) language. You can define your own elements, attributes, and types, and then use these custom schemas in your Spring Boot configuration files. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix.html#xml-custom)"
"What are the steps involved in the application startup process in Spring Boot?","The application startup process in Spring Boot involves several steps, including environment initialization, context initialization, and context refreshing. During these steps, Spring Boot loads the application context, initializes beans, and performs any necessary configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix.html#application-startup-steps)"
"What is the purpose of the <util:properties> element in Spring XML configuration?","The <util:properties> element is used to create a java.util.Properties instance with values loaded from the supplied location. This element is a more concise representation of using a Spring FactoryBean implementation (the PropertiesFactoryBean) to instantiate a java.util.Properties instance with values loaded from the supplied Resource location. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xsd-schemas.html)"
"What is the difference between using <util:list> and the ListFactoryBean in Spring XML configuration?","The <util:list> element is a more concise way to create a java.util.List instance and initialize it with values. It is an alternative to using a Spring FactoryBean implementation (the ListFactoryBean) to create a java.util.List instance with values loaded from the supplied 'sourceList'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xsd-schemas.html)"
"How can I explicitly control the type of Map that is instantiated and populated using the <util:map> element in Spring XML configuration?","To explicitly control the type of Map that is instantiated and populated using the <util:map> element, you can use the 'map-class' attribute. For example, if you need a java.util.TreeMap to be instantiated, you can use the following configuration: <util:map id='emails' map-class='java.util.TreeMap'>. If no 'map-class' attribute is supplied, the container chooses a Map implementation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xsd-schemas.html)"
"What is the process to create a custom XML bean definition parser in Spring?","To create a custom XML bean definition parser in Spring, you need to author an XML schema to describe your custom element(s), code a custom NamespaceHandler implementation, code one or more BeanDefinitionParser implementations, and register your new artifacts with Spring. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xml-custom.html)"
"What is the purpose of a NamespaceHandler in Spring?","A NamespaceHandler in Spring is responsible for parsing all elements of a specific namespace and is called when Spring encounters a top-level element. It can register bean definitions, return a bean definition, or both. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xml-custom.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/groovy.html)"
"How can I specify the location of Groovy configuration files in my test class?","You can specify the location of Groovy configuration files by using the locations or value attribute of the @ContextConfiguration annotation. The following example shows how to specify Groovy configuration files: Java Kotlin @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from ""/AppConfig.groovy"" and // ""/TestConfig.groovy"" in the root of the classpath @ContextConfiguration({""/AppConfig.groovy"", ""/TestConfig.Groovy""}) class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Specifying the location of Groovy configuration files. @ExtendWith(SpringExtension::class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from ""/AppConfig.groovy"" and // ""/TestConfig.groovy"" in the root of the classpath @ContextConfiguration(""/AppConfig.groovy"", ""/TestConfig.Groovy"") class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Specifying the location of Groovy configuration files. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/groovy.html)"
"How can I load configuration from the default location in my test class?","If you omit both the locations and value attributes from the @ContextConfiguration annotation, the TestContext framework tries to detect a default Groovy script. Specifically, GenericGroovyXmlContextLoader and GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader detect a default location based on the name of the test class. If your class is named com.example.MyTest, the Groovy context loader loads your application context from ""classpath:com/example/MyTestContext.groovy"". The following example shows how to use the default: Java Kotlin @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from // ""classpath:com/example/MyTestContext.groovy"" @ContextConfiguration class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Loading configuration from the default location. @ExtendWith(SpringExtension::class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from // ""classpath:com/example/MyTestContext.groovy"" @ContextConfiguration class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Loading configuration from the default location. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/groovy.html)"
"How can you load an ApplicationContext for your tests using component classes?","You can annotate your test class with @ContextConfiguration and configure the classes attribute with an array that contains references to component classes. The following example shows how to do so: Java Kotlin @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from AppConfig and TestConfig @ContextConfiguration(classes = {AppConfig.class, TestConfig.class}) (1) class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Specifying component classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/javaconfig.html)"

"Can you mix XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, and component classes to configure an ApplicationContext for tests?","Yes, it is possible to mix XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, and component classes (typically @Configuration classes) to configure an ApplicationContext for your tests. Some third-party frameworks, such as Spring Boot, provide first-class support for loading an ApplicationContext from different types of resources simultaneously. However, most of the SmartContextLoader implementations in the spring-test module support only one resource type for each test context. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/mixed-config.html)"
"How can you use both resource locations (e.g., XML or Groovy) and @Configuration classes to configure your tests?","To use both resource locations (e.g., XML or Groovy) and @Configuration classes to configure your tests, you must pick one as the entry point, and that one must include or import the other. In XML or Groovy scripts, you can include @Configuration classes by using component scanning or defining them as normal Spring beans. In a @Configuration class, you can use @ImportResource to import XML configuration files or Groovy scripts. This behavior is semantically equivalent to how you configure your application in production. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/mixed-config.html)"
"What are the exceptions to the general rule of using only one resource type for each test context in the Spring Framework?","The GenericGroovyXmlContextLoader and GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader support both XML configuration files and Groovy scripts simultaneously.

"How does a test class inherit resource locations or component classes as well as the context initializers declared by any superclasses in Spring Boot?","The resource locations or component classes for a test class are appended to the list of resource locations or annotated classes declared by superclasses. The initializers for a given test class are added to the set of initializers defined by test superclasses. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/inheritance.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @TestPropertySource annotation in Spring Framework?","The purpose of the @TestPropertySource annotation in Spring Framework is to declare resource locations for test properties files or inlined properties, which are added to the set of PropertySources in the Environment for the ApplicationContext loaded for the annotated integration test.

"How can you configure test properties files using the @TestPropertySource annotation?","To configure test properties files using the @TestPropertySource annotation, you can use the locations or value attribute of @TestPropertySource. By default, both traditional and XML-based java.util.Properties file formats are supported. For example, you can use 'classpath:/com/example/test.properties' or 'file:///path/to/file.xml'. You can also use a plain path (for example, 'test.properties') which is treated as a classpath resource relative to the package in which the test class is defined. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/property-sources.html)"
"How can you configure inlined properties in the @TestPropertySource annotation?","To configure inlined properties in the @TestPropertySource annotation, you can use the properties attribute of @TestPropertySource. All key-value pairs are added to the enclosing Environment as a single test PropertySource with the highest precedence. The supported syntax for key-value pairs is the same as the syntax defined for entries in a Java properties file: key=value, key:value, or key value. As of Spring Framework 6.1, you can use text blocks to define multiple inlined properties in a single String.

"How does Spring TestContext framework cache ApplicationContexts for tests?","The TestContext framework caches ApplicationContexts (or WebApplicationContexts) for tests by generating a unique key based on the combination of configuration parameters used to load the context. This key is used to store the context in a static cache. If subsequent tests in the same test suite have the same unique combination of configuration parameters, they share the same ApplicationContext, reducing setup time. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.html)"
"What are the factors that determine whether two tests share the same ApplicationContext in the TestContext framework?","Two tests in the same test suite will share the same ApplicationContext if they have the same unique combination of configuration parameters, including locations, classes, contextInitializerClasses, contextCustomizers, contextLoader, parent, activeProfiles, propertySourceDescriptors, propertySourceProperties, and resourceBasePath. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.html)"
"How can I ensure that all tests in a suite run within the same process to benefit from ApplicationContext caching?","To ensure that all tests run within the same process and benefit from ApplicationContext caching, you can execute all tests as a group within an IDE or configure your build framework, such as Ant, Maven, or Gradle, to not fork between tests. For example, in Maven, you should not set the forkMode for the Surefire plug-in to always or pertest.

"What is the purpose of the context failure threshold policy in Spring Framework 6.1?","The context failure threshold policy in Spring Framework 6.1 helps avoid repeated attempts to load a failing ApplicationContext. This prevents individual test classes and test suites from taking longer to fail when a configuration error or missing external resource prevents the context from loading. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html)"
"By default, how many attempts are made to load an ApplicationContext for a given context cache key?","By default, only one attempt is made to load an ApplicationContext for a given context cache key. Any subsequent attempt to load the ApplicationContext for the same context cache key will result in an immediate IllegalStateException. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html)"
"How can you configure the context failure threshold in Spring Framework 6.1?","You can configure the context failure threshold from the command line or a build script by setting a JVM system property named spring.test.context.failure.threshold with a positive integer value. Alternatively, you can set the same property via the SpringProperties mechanism. To effectively disable the context failure threshold, you can set the property to a very large value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html)"
"What is the purpose of using a context hierarchy in Spring integration tests?","The purpose of using a context hierarchy in Spring integration tests is to test against a hierarchy of ApplicationContext instances. This is beneficial or necessary when developing a Spring MVC web application or Spring Batch applications, where shared components and infrastructure configuration are declared in the root context and consumed in the child context by web-specific components. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/hierarchies.html)"
"How can you declare a context hierarchy in a single test class?","You can declare a context hierarchy in a single test class by using the @ContextHierarchy annotation, either on an individual test class or within a test class hierarchy. This allows you to test against a hierarchy of ApplicationContext instances. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/hierarchies.html)"
"How can you merge or override the context configuration for a specific, named level in the context hierarchy?","To merge or override the context configuration for a specific, named level in the context hierarchy, you can use the name attribute in @ContextConfiguration. This allows you to merge or override the context configuration for a given level in the hierarchy, ensuring that the configuration resource type (XML configuration files or component classes) is consistent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/hierarchies.html)"
"What is the purpose of the DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener in Spring Boot?","The DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener is responsible for injecting dependencies of test instances from beans in the application context. This is configured by default and supports setter injection, field injection, and constructor injection for JUnit Jupiter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.html)"
"How can you use field injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot?","To use field injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot, you can annotate the field with @Autowired or @Inject. This approach is encouraged in test code as you will never instantiate your test class directly. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.html)"
"How can you use setter injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot?","To use setter injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot, you can annotate the setter method with @Autowired or @Inject. This approach is also supported and allows you to inject dependencies into your test instances. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.html)"
"How can I ensure a WebApplicationContext is loaded for my test in Spring?","You can annotate your test class with @WebAppConfiguration to ensure a WebApplicationContext is loaded for your test. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/web-scoped-beans.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TestContext framework in Spring?","The TestContext framework in Spring provides support for testing web-scoped beans such as request- and session-scoped beans. It allows you to configure request and session parameters through mocks. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/web-scoped-beans.html)"
"How can I inject a mock request or session into my test instance in Spring?","You can inject the mock request or session into your test instance by using dependency injection. This allows you to prepare your test fixture and invoke your web component. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/web-scoped-beans.html)"
"How are transactions managed in the TestContext framework?","Transactions are managed by the TransactionalTestExecutionListener, which is configured by default even if you do not explicitly declare @TestExecutionListeners on your test class. To enable support for transactions, you must configure a PlatformTransactionManager bean in the ApplicationContext that is loaded with @ContextConfiguration semantics. In addition, you must declare Spring’s @Transactional annotation either at the class or the method level for your tests."
"What are test-managed transactions and how do they differ from Spring-managed and application-managed transactions?","Test-managed transactions are transactions that are managed declaratively by using the TransactionalTestExecutionListener or programmatically by using TestTransaction. They differ from Spring-managed and application-managed transactions in that they participate in test-managed transactions. However, caution must be taken if Spring-managed or application-managed transactions are configured with any propagation type other than REQUIRED or SUPPORTS."
"How can you enable and disable transactions in the TestContext framework?","Transactions can be enabled by annotating a test method with @Transactional. If a test class is annotated with @Transactional, each test method within that class hierarchy runs within a transaction. Test methods that are not annotated with @Transactional are not run within a transaction. Note that @Transactional is not supported on test lifecycle methods and tests that are annotated with @Transactional but have the propagation attribute set to NOT_SUPPORTED or NEVER are not run within a transaction."
"How can you initialize an embedded or existing database by executing SQL scripts in Spring?","You can use the spring-jdbc module, which provides support for initializing a database by executing SQL scripts when the Spring ApplicationContext is loaded. See Embedded database support(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/reference/html/data-access.html#data-access-jdbc-embedded-database-support) and Testing data access logic with an embedded database(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/reference/html/data-access.html#data-access-jdbc-embedded-database-support-dao-testing) for details."
"What are the options for executing SQL scripts programmatically within integration test methods in Spring?","Spring provides the following options: org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init.ScriptUtils, org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init.ResourceDatabasePopulator, org.springframework.test.context.junit4.AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests, and org.springframework.test.context.testng.AbstractTransactionalTestNGSpringContextTests. ScriptUtils provides a collection of static utility methods for working with SQL scripts and is mainly intended for internal use within the framework. ResourceDatabasePopulator provides an object-based API for programmatically populating, initializing, or cleaning up a database by using SQL scripts defined in external resources. The executeSqlScript(..) methods in AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests and AbstractTransactionalTestNGSpringContextTests internally use a ResourceDatabasePopulator to run SQL scripts. See the Javadoc for the various executeSqlScript(..) methods for further details."
"How can you declaratively configure SQL scripts in the Spring TestContext Framework?","You can declare the @Sql annotation on a test class or test method to configure individual SQL statements or the resource paths to SQL scripts that should be run against a given database before or after an integration test class or test method. Support for @Sql is provided by the SqlScriptsTestExecutionListener, which is enabled by default. Method-level @Sql declarations override class-level declarations by default, but this behavior may be configured per test class or per test method via @SqlMergeMode. See Merging and Overriding Configuration with @SqlMergeMode(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/reference/html/testcontext-framework.html#testcontext-executing-sql-declaratively-script-merging) for further details."
"When was the basic support for executing tests in parallel within a single JVM introduced in Spring Framework?","Spring Framework 5.0 (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/parallel-test-execution.html)"
"What are the general guidelines for when not to run tests in parallel in Spring Framework?","Do not run tests in parallel if they use @DirtiesContext, @MockBean or @SpyBean, @FixMethodOrder, or change the state of shared services or systems. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/parallel-test-execution.html)"
"What is the maximum size of the ContextCache and how can it be increased?","The maximum size of the ContextCache is not specified in the given information. To increase the maximum size of the cache, you can adjust the configuration settings for your testing framework, build tool, or IDE. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/parallel-test-execution.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring TestContext Framework, and how does it integrate with JUnit 4?","The Spring TestContext Framework offers full integration with JUnit 4 through a custom runner (supported on JUnit 4.12 or higher). By annotating test classes with @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) or the shorter @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) variant, developers can implement standard JUnit 4-based unit and integration tests and simultaneously reap the benefits of the TestContext framework, such as support for loading application contexts, dependency injection of test instances, transactional test method execution, and so on. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.html)"
"What are the advantages of using Spring's rule-based JUnit support instead of the SpringRunner?","Spring’s rule-based JUnit support has the advantage of being independent of any org.junit.runner.Runner implementation and can, therefore, be combined with existing alternative runners (such as JUnit 4’s Parameterized ) or third-party runners (such as the MockitoJUnitRunner ). To support the full functionality of the TestContext framework, you must combine a SpringClassRule with a SpringMethodRule. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.html)"
"How does the SpringExtension for JUnit Jupiter provide integration with the JUnit Jupiter testing framework?","By annotating test classes with @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class), you can implement standard JUnit Jupiter-based unit and integration tests and simultaneously reap the benefits of the TestContext framework, such as support for loading application contexts, dependency injection of test instances, transactional test method execution, and so on. Furthermore, thanks to the rich extension API in JUnit Jupiter, Spring provides the following features above and beyond the feature set that Spring supports for JUnit 4 and TestNG: Dependency injection for test constructors, test methods, and test lifecycle callback methods. Powerful support for conditional test execution based on SpEL expressions, environment variables, system properties, and so on. Custom composed annotations that combine annotations from Spring and JUnit Jupiter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's Ahead of Time (AOT) support for integration tests?","The purpose of Spring's Ahead of Time (AOT) support for integration tests is to provide build-time detection of all integration tests in the current project that use the TestContext framework to load an ApplicationContext. It also extends Spring's core AOT support with features like explicit support for test classes based on JUnit Jupiter and JUnit 4, as well as implicit support for TestNG and other testing frameworks that use Spring's core testing annotations. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/aot.html>)"
"What are the build-time and runtime AOT support features in Spring's AOT support for integration tests?","The build-time AOT support feature in Spring's AOT support for integration tests is that each unique test ApplicationContext in the current project will be refreshed for AOT processing. The runtime AOT support feature is that when executing in AOT runtime mode, a Spring integration test will use an AOT-optimized ApplicationContext that participates transparently with the context cache. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/aot.html>)"
"How can you disable an entire test class or individual test method in AOT mode?","You can selectively disable an entire test class or individual test method in AOT mode by annotating it with @DisabledInAotMode. When using JUnit Jupiter, you may selectively enable or disable tests in a GraalVM native image via Jupiter’s @EnabledInNativeImage and @DisabledInNativeImage annotations. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/aot.html>)"
"What is MockMvc and what is its purpose in testing Spring MVC applications?","MockMvc is a Spring MVC Test framework that provides support for testing Spring MVC applications. It performs full Spring MVC request handling but via mock request and response objects instead of a running server. Its purpose is to allow developers to test their Spring MVC applications without the need for a running server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework.html)"
"How can MockMvc be used in testing Spring MVC applications?","MockMvc can be used on its own to perform requests and verify responses. It can also be used through the WebTestClient, where MockMvc is plugged in as the server to handle requests with. The advantage of WebTestClient is the option to work with higher level objects instead of raw data as well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests against a live server and use the same test API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework.html)"
"What are some advantages of using WebTestClient over MockMvc in testing Spring MVC applications?","The advantage of WebTestClient is the option to work with higher level objects instead of raw data as well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests against a live server and use the same test API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring MVC Test framework?","The Spring MVC Test framework, also known as MockMvc, aims to provide more complete testing for Spring MVC controllers without a running server. It does that by invoking the DispatcherServlet and passing ‘mock’ implementations of the Servlet API(../unit.html#mock-objects-servlet) from the spring-test module which replicates the full Spring MVC request handling without a running server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server.html)"
"What are the limitations of plain unit tests for Spring MVC?","Plain unit tests for Spring MVC do not verify request mappings, data binding, message conversion, type conversion, validation, and nor do they involve any of the supporting @InitBinder, @ModelAttribute, or @ExceptionHandler methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server.html)"
"How can you use MockMvc in your tests?","You can use MockMvc on its own to perform requests and to verify responses, or you can also use it through the WebTestClient(../webtestclient.html) API with MockMvc plugged in as the server to handle requests with. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server.html)"
"What are static imports and when do you need them in MockMvc?","Static imports are used to import static methods or classes from a specific class. You'll need static imports for MockMvcBuilders, MockMvcRequestBuilders, MockMvcResultMatchers, and MockMvcResultHandlers when using MockMvc directly to perform requests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-static-imports.html)"
"How can you remember the static imports for MockMvc?","An easy way to remember the static imports for MockMvc is to search for MockMvc*. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-static-imports.html)"
"Do you need static imports when using the WebTestClient with MockMvc?","No, you do not need static imports when using the WebTestClient with MockMvc as it provides a fluent API without static imports. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-static-imports.html)"
"What are the two ways to setup MockMvc for testing in Spring MVC?","The two ways to setup MockMvc for testing in Spring MVC are: 1) Pointing directly to the controllers you want to test and programmatically configuring Spring MVC infrastructure using MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(). 2) Pointing to Spring configuration with Spring MVC and controller infrastructure in it using MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-setup-options.html)"
"How can you inject mock services into controllers when setting up MockMvc through Spring configuration?","You can inject mock services into controllers when setting up MockMvc through Spring configuration by declaring a mock service with Mockito using a <bean> tag in your Spring configuration XML file. Then, you can autowire the mock service into your test class and use it to set up and verify expectations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-setup-options.html)"
"What is the difference between using standaloneSetup and webAppContextSetup for MockMvc setup in terms of testing focus and Spring MVC configuration verification?","The standaloneSetup is a little closer to a unit test, testing one controller at a time and not involving the loading of Spring configuration. This setup is more focused on style and makes it easier to see which controller is being tested, whether any specific Spring MVC configuration is required to work, and so on. On the other hand, the webAppContextSetup loads your actual Spring MVC configuration, resulting in a more complete integration test. Using the webAppContextSetup helps keep tests running fast, even as you introduce more tests in your test suite, and allows you to inject mock services into controllers through Spring configuration to remain focused on testing the web layer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-setup-options.html)"
"How can I perform file upload requests using MockMvc?","To perform file upload requests using MockMvc, you can use the multipart() method, which internally uses MockMultipartHttpServletRequest. This allows you to set up the request in a similar way to the following example: mockMvc.perform(multipart(""/doc"").file(""a1"", ""ABC"".getBytes(""UTF-8""))); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-performing-requests.html)"
"How can I specify query parameters in a request using MockMvc?","To specify query parameters in a request using MockMvc, you can use URI template style in the request URI.

"How can I add Servlet request parameters to a request using MockMvc?","To add Servlet request parameters to a request using MockMvc, you can use the param() method. For example: mockMvc.perform(get(""/hotels"").param(""thing"", ""somewhere"")); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-performing-requests.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Async Requests section in the Spring Boot documentation?","The Async Requests section in the Spring Boot documentation shows how to use MockMvc to test asynchronous request handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/async-requests.html)"
"How do asynchronous requests work in Spring MVC?","In Spring MVC, asynchronous requests work by exiting the Servlet container thread and allowing the application to compute the response asynchronously, after which an async dispatch is made to complete processing on a Servlet container thread. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/async-requests.html)"
"How can async requests be tested in Spring MVC Test?","In Spring MVC Test, async requests can be tested by asserting the produced async value first, then manually performing the async dispatch, and finally verifying the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/async-requests.html)"
"Can MockMvcWebTestClient handle testing infinite streams?","No, MockMvcWebTestClient does not support infinite streams because there is no way to cancel the server stream from the client side.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-htmlunit/geb.html)"
"How can I test client-side code that uses the RestTemplate in Spring Boot?","You can use client-side tests to test code that internally uses the RestTemplate. The idea is to declare expected requests and to provide ‘stub’ responses so that you can focus on testing the code in isolation (that is, without running a server). The following example shows how to do so: Java Kotlin RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build(); mockServer.expect(requestTo('/greeting')).andRespond(withSuccess()); // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify(); val restTemplate = RestTemplate() val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build() mockServer.expect(requestTo('/greeting')).andRespond(withSuccess()) // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify() In the preceding example, MockRestServiceServer (the central class for client-side REST tests) configures the RestTemplate with a custom ClientHttpRequestFactory that asserts actual requests against expectations and returns ‘stub’ responses. In this case, we expect a request to /greeting and want to return a 200 response with text/plain content. We can define additional expected requests and stub responses as needed. When we define expected requests and stub responses, the RestTemplate can be used in client-side code as usual. At the end of testing, mockServer.verify() can be used to verify that all expectations have been satisfied. By default, requests are expected in the order in which expectations were declared. You can set the ignoreExpectOrder option when building the server, in which case all expectations are checked (in order) to find a match for a given request. That means requests are allowed to come in any order. The following example uses ignoreExpectOrder : Java Kotlin server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).ignoreExpectOrder(true).build(); server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).ignoreExpectOrder(true).build() Even with unordered requests by default, each request is allowed to run once only. The expect method provides an overloaded variant that accepts an ExpectedCount argument that specifies a count range (for example, once , manyTimes , max , min , between , and so on). The following example uses times : Java Kotlin RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build(); mockServer.expect(times(2), requestTo('/something')).andRespond(withSuccess()); mockServer.expect(times(3), requestTo('/somewhere')).andRespond(withSuccess()); // ... mockServer.verify(); val restTemplate = RestTemplate() val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build() mockServer.expect(times(2), requestTo('/something')).andRespond(withSuccess()) mockServer.expect(times(3), requestTo('/somewhere')).andRespond(withSuccess()) // ... mockServer.verify() Note that, when ignoreExpectOrder is not set (the default), and, therefore, requests are expected in order of declaration, then that order applies only to the first of any expected request. For example if '/something' is expected two times followed by '/somewhere' three times, then there should be a request to '/something' before there is a request to '/somewhere', but, aside from that subsequent '/something' and '/somewhere', requests can come at any time. As an alternative to all of the above, the client-side test support also provides a ClientHttpRequestFactory implementation that you can configure into a RestTemplate to bind it to a MockMvc instance. That allows processing requests using actual server-side logic but without running a server. The following example shows how to do so: Java Kotlin MockMvc mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.wac).build(); this.restTemplate = new RestTemplate(new MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory(mockMvc)); // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... val mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.wac).build() restTemplate = RestTemplate(MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory(mockMvc)) // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... In some cases it may be necessary to perform an actual call to a remote service instead of mocking the response. The following example shows how to do that through ExecutingResponseCreator : Java Kotlin RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); // Create ExecutingResponseCreator with the original request factory ExecutingResponseCreator withActualResponse = new ExecutingResponseCreator(restTemplate.getRequestFactory()); MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build(); mockServer.expect(requestTo('/profile')).andRespond(withSuccess()); mockServer.expect(requestTo('/quoteOfTheDay')).andRespond(withActualResponse); // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify(); val restTemplate = RestTemplate() // Create ExecutingResponseCreator with the original request factory val withActualResponse = new ExecutingResponseCreator(restTemplate.getRequestFactory()) val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build() mockServer.expect(requestTo('/profile')).andRespond(withSuccess()) mockServer.expect(requestTo('/quoteOfTheDay')).andRespond(withActualResponse) // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify() In the preceding example, we create the ExecutingResponseCreator using the ClientHttpRequestFactory from the RestTemplate before MockRestServiceServer replaces it with a different one that mocks responses. Then we define expectations with two kinds of responses: a stub 200 response for the /profile endpoint (no actual request will be executed) a response obtained through a call to the /quoteOfTheDay endpoint In the second case, the request is executed through the ClientHttpRequestFactory that was captured earlier. This generates a response that could e.g. come from an actual remote server, depending on how the RestTemplate was originally configured. Static Imports: As with server-side tests, the fluent API for client-side tests requires a few static imports. Those are easy to find by searching for MockRest* . Eclipse users should add MockRestRequestMatchers.* and MockRestResponseCreators.* as “favorite static members” in the Eclipse preferences under Java → Editor → Content Assist → Favorites. That allows using content assist after typing the first character of the static method name. Other IDEs (such IntelliJ) may not require any additional configuration. Check for the support for code completion on static members. Further Examples of Client-side REST Tests: Spring MVC Test’s own tests include example tests(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/web/client/samples) of client-side REST tests.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-junit4.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @SpringJUnitConfig annotation in Spring Boot testing?","The @SpringJUnitConfig annotation is used to replace @ContextConfiguration and can be used at the class level to specify a configuration class or the location of a configuration file. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-junit-jupiter.html)"
"What is the difference between @SpringJUnitWebConfig and @SpringJUnitConfig?","@SpringJUnitWebConfig is a composed annotation that combines @ContextConfiguration, @WebAppConfiguration, and @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) from JUnit Jupiter. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for @ContextConfiguration and @WebAppConfiguration and allows overriding the value attribute from @WebAppConfiguration only by using the resourcePath attribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-junit-jupiter.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @TestConstructor annotation in Spring Boot testing?","@TestConstructor is a type-level annotation that is used to configure how the parameters of a test class constructor are autowired from components in the test's ApplicationContext. If @TestConstructor is not present or meta-present on a test class, the default test constructor autowire mode will be used. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-junit-jupiter.html)"
"What is the purpose of using meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing?","The purpose of using meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing is to create custom composed annotations and reduce configuration duplication across a test suite. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-meta.html)"
"Which test-related annotations can be used as meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing?","Most test-related annotations can be used as meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing, including @BootstrapWith, @ContextConfiguration, @ContextHierarchy, @ContextCustomizerFactories, @ActiveProfiles, @TestPropertySource, @DirtiesContext, @WebAppConfiguration, @TestExecutionListeners, @Transactional, @BeforeTransaction, @AfterTransaction, @Commit, @Rollback, @Sql, @SqlConfig, @SqlMergeMode, @SqlGroup, @Repeat (only supported on JUnit 4), @Timed (only supported on JUnit 4), @IfProfileValue (only supported on JUnit 4), @ProfileValueSourceConfiguration (only supported on JUnit 4), @SpringJUnitConfig (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @SpringJUnitWebConfig (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @TestConstructor (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @NestedTestConfiguration (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @EnabledIf (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), and @DisabledIf (only supported on JUnit Jupiter). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-meta.html)"
"How can you simplify the configuration of individual test classes using meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing?","You can simplify the configuration of individual test classes using meta-annotations by introducing a custom composed annotation that centralizes the common test configuration for Spring or Spring and JUnit Jupiter. This custom annotation can then be used to simplify the configuration of individual test classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-meta.html)"
"What is JUnit and what are its key features?","JUnit is a programmer-friendly testing framework for Java and the JVM.

"What is the purpose of the 'DAO Support' section in the 'Data Access' section?","The 'DAO Support' section in the 'Data Access' section provides support for the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access.html)"
"What are the benefits of using the Spring Framework's transaction management?","The Spring Framework provides a consistent abstraction for transaction management that delivers the following benefits: A consistent programming model across different transaction APIs, support for declarative transaction management, a simpler API for programmatic transaction management, and excellent integration with Spring's data access abstractions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html)"
"How can the Spring Framework's transaction abstraction be configured and obtained?","The Spring Framework transaction abstraction can be configured and obtained by understanding the core classes and describing how to configure and obtain DataSource instances from a variety of sources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html)"
"What are the different types of transaction management supported by the Spring Framework?","The Spring Framework supports both declarative and programmatic transaction management. Declarative transaction management allows transactions to be defined using annotations or XML configurations, while programmatic transaction management involves explicitly coding transactions within the application code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html)"
"What are the two traditional choices for transaction management in EE application development?","The two traditional choices for transaction management in EE application development are global transactions and local transactions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/motivation.html)"
"What are the limitations of global transactions and how does the Spring Framework address them?","Global transactions have limitations such as being cumbersome to use, requiring JNDI lookups, and limiting reusability of application code. The Spring Framework addresses these limitations by providing a consistent programming model that allows developers to use declarative or programmatic transaction management and change the transaction management strategy without changing the code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/motivation.html)"
"What are the disadvantages of local transactions and how does the Spring Framework improve upon them?","Local transactions are resource-specific and cannot work across multiple transactional resources, making them less flexible. The Spring Framework improves upon this by providing a consistent programming model that allows developers to use declarative transaction management and change the transaction management strategy without changing the code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/motivation.html)"
"What is the key to the Spring transaction abstraction?","The key to the Spring transaction abstraction is the notion of a transaction strategy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/strategies.html)"
"What is the difference between a PlatformTransactionManager and a ReactiveTransactionManager?","The PlatformTransactionManager is for imperative transaction management, while the ReactiveTransactionManager is for reactive transaction management. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/strategies.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TransactionDefinition interface in Spring Framework?","The TransactionDefinition interface specifies properties such as propagation, isolation, timeout, and read-only status for a transaction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/strategies.html)"
"What is the preferred approach to ensure proper handling of resources in Spring's persistence integration APIs?","The preferred approach is to use Spring’s highest-level template-based persistence integration APIs or to use native ORM APIs with transaction-aware factory beans or proxies for managing the native resource factories. These transaction-aware solutions internally handle resource creation and reuse, cleanup, optional transaction synchronization of the resources, and exception mapping. Thus, user data access code does not have to address these tasks but can focus purely on non-boilerplate persistence logic. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-resource-synchronization.html)"
"What is the low-level synchronization approach in Spring's persistence integration APIs?","At a lower level, classes such as DataSourceUtils (for JDBC), EntityManagerFactoryUtils (for JPA), SessionFactoryUtils (for Hibernate), and so on exist. When you want the application code to deal directly with the resource types of the native persistence APIs, you use these classes to ensure that proper Spring Framework-managed instances are obtained, transactions are (optionally) synchronized, and exceptions that occur in the process are properly mapped to a consistent API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-resource-synchronization.html)"
"What is the TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy class in Spring's persistence integration APIs?","The TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy class is a proxy for a target DataSource , which wraps the target DataSource to add awareness of Spring-managed transactions. It is similar to a transactional JNDI DataSource , as provided by a Jakarta EE server. You should almost never need or want to use this class, except when existing code must be called and passed a standard JDBC DataSource interface implementation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-resource-synchronization.html)"
"What is the main advantage of using declarative transaction management in Spring Boot compared to programmatic transaction management?","The main advantage of using declarative transaction management in Spring Boot compared to programmatic transaction management is that it has the least impact on application code and is most consistent with the ideals of a non-invasive lightweight container. This means that less changes are required in the application code to manage transactions, making it more straightforward and less prone to errors. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative.html)"
"Can you explain the concept of 'rollback rules' in Spring Boot's declarative transaction management?","In Spring Boot's declarative transaction management, 'rollback rules' allow you to specify which exceptions or throwables should cause automatic rollback of a transaction. This means that you can define certain exceptions that, when thrown, will automatically roll back the transaction without the need for additional code. This feature is unique to Spring Boot and is not available in EJB CMT. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative.html)"
"How does Spring Boot's declarative transaction management differ from EJB CMT in terms of transactional behavior customization?","Spring Boot's declarative transaction management allows for more customization of transactional behavior compared to EJB CMT. In Spring Boot, you can use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to insert custom behavior in the case of transaction rollback, add arbitrary advice along with transactional advice, and customize transactional behavior. In contrast, EJB CMT does not allow for any customization of transaction management, and you can only use the setRollbackOnly() method to influence the container's transaction management. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative.html)"
"What are the two flavors of transaction management in the Spring Framework and how do they differ?","The two flavors of transaction management in the Spring Framework are imperative and reactive. Imperative transactions use PlatformTransactionManager and are thread-bound, while reactive transactions use ReactiveTransactionManager and are context-bound within the same reactive pipeline. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/tx-decl-explained.html)"
"What is the role of the TransactionInterceptor in the Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure?","The TransactionInterceptor detects the desired flavor of transaction management by inspecting the method return type and uses a TransactionManager implementation to drive transactions around method invocations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/tx-decl-explained.html)"
"How does the Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure use AOP proxies and transactional metadata?","The Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure uses AOP proxies and transactional metadata (XML or annotation-based) to create an AOP proxy that uses a TransactionInterceptor in conjunction with a TransactionManager implementation to drive transactions around method invocations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/tx-decl-explained.html)"
"What is the purpose of the <tx:advice/> element in the provided Spring Boot transaction configuration?","The <tx:advice/> element encapsulates the transactional semantics and is used to define the transactional behavior for the service methods. It specifies that all methods starting with 'get' are to run in the context of a read-only transaction, and all other methods are to run with the default transaction semantics. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.html)"
"How is a transactional proxy created around the fooService bean in the provided Spring Boot transaction configuration?","The transactional proxy is created using the AOP infrastructure. The configuration creates an implicit proxy for the fooService bean, which is configured with the transactional advice. When an appropriate method is invoked on the proxy, a transaction is started, suspended, marked as read-only, and so on, depending on the transaction configuration associated with that method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.html)"
"What is the purpose of the <aop:config/> element in the provided Spring Boot transaction configuration?","The <aop:config/> element ensures that the transactional advice defined by the txAdvice bean runs at the appropriate points in the program. It defines a pointcut that matches the execution of any operation defined in the FooService interface and associates the pointcut with the txAdvice using an advisor. This results in the advice defined by txAdvice being run at the execution of a fooServiceOperation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.html)"
"How can you control the rollback of transactions in a simple, declarative fashion in XML configuration using Spring Boot?","You can control the rollback of transactions in a simple, declarative fashion in XML configuration using Spring Boot by specifying rollback rules. Rollback rules determine if a transaction should be rolled back when a given exception is thrown, and the rules are based on exception types or exception patterns. Rollback rules may be configured in XML via the rollback-for and no-rollback-for attributes, which allow rules to be defined as patterns. You can also indicate a required rollback programmatically using TransactionAspectSupport.currentTransactionStatus().setRollbackOnly(); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.html)"
"What is the recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure that a transaction’s work is to be rolled back?","The recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure that a transaction’s work is to be rolled back is to throw an Exception from code that is currently executing in the context of a transaction. The Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure code catches any unhandled Exception as it bubbles up the call stack and makes a determination whether to mark the transaction for rollback. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.html)"
"What is the default configuration for marking a transaction for rollback in the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure code?","In its default configuration, the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure code marks a transaction for rollback only in the case of runtime, unchecked exceptions. That is, when the thrown exception is an instance or subclass of RuntimeException. (Error instances also, by default, result in a rollback). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.html)"
"How can you apply different transactional configurations to different service layer objects in Spring Boot?","You can define distinct <aop:advisor/> elements with differing pointcut and advice-ref attribute values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/diff-tx.html)"
"How do you make all beans that are instances of classes defined in a root package and have names ending in 'Service' have the default transactional configuration?","You can use an <aop:advisor/> element with a pointcut that matches the required classes and methods, and an advice that references the default transactional configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/diff-tx.html)"
"How can you configure two distinct beans with totally different transactional settings in Spring Boot?","You can define two distinct pointcuts that match the required classes and methods, and two distinct advisors that reference the transactional configurations for each bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/diff-tx.html)"
"What is the default propagation setting for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag?","The default propagation setting for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag is REQUIRED. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/txadvice-settings.html>)"
"What is the default isolation level for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag?","The default isolation level for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag is DEFAULT. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/txadvice-settings.html>)"
"How can you change the default transaction settings in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag?","You can change the default transaction settings in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag by specifying the required attributes within the <tx:method/> tags that are nested within <tx:advice/> and <tx:attributes/> tags. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/txadvice-settings.html>)"
"What are the two ways to configure transactions in Spring Boot?","The two ways to configure transactions in Spring Boot are XML-based declarative approach and annotation-based approach. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot?","The @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to specify that an interface, class, or method should have transactional semantics. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html)"
"What is the difference between class-based and interface-based proxies in Spring Boot?","Class-based proxies are created when the proxy-target-class attribute is set to true, while interface-based proxies are created when proxy-target-class is false or omitted. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html)"
"What is the difference between physical and logical transactions in Spring-managed transactions?","In Spring-managed transactions, physical transactions are actual transactions that affect the underlying resources, while logical transactions are scopes within a method that can determine rollback-only status independently. Each logical transaction scope can be mapped to the same physical transaction or to an independent physical transaction, depending on the propagation setting."
"What does PROPAGATION_REQUIRED mean in Spring transaction propagation?","PROPAGATION_REQUIRED enforces a physical transaction, either locally for the current scope if no transaction exists yet or participating in an existing 'outer' transaction defined for a larger scope. By default, a participating transaction joins the characteristics of the outer scope, silently ignoring the local isolation level, timeout value, or read-only flag (if any)."
"How does PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW differ from PROPAGATION_REQUIRED in Spring transaction propagation?","PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW always uses an independent physical transaction for each affected transaction scope, never participating in an existing transaction for an outer scope. In contrast, PROPAGATION_REQUIRED can participate in an existing transaction for an outer scope and can inherit the characteristics of the outer scope."
"How can you configure a fooService bean with both profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot?","You can configure a fooService bean with both profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot by creating a SimpleProfiler bean that implements the Ordered interface and setting the order property to control the ordering of advice. Then, you can apply the transactional and profiling aspects to the fooService bean using the <tx:annotation-driven/> element and an <aop:config> element, respectively. The following configuration creates a fooService bean with profiling and transactional aspects applied in the desired order: XML configuration code here (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/applying-more-than-just-tx-advice.html>)"
"How do you configure additional aspects with the desired order in Spring Boot?","To configure additional aspects with the desired order in Spring Boot, you can follow a similar approach as shown in the provided information. You can create a new bean for each aspect, set the order property to control the ordering of advice, and then apply the aspect to the desired beans using an <aop:config> element. The order value should be higher than the previous aspect to ensure the desired execution order. For example, to add another aspect, you can create a new bean for the aspect, set the order property, and then apply the aspect using an <aop:advisor> element. The following example creates the same setup as the previous examples but uses the purely XML declarative approach: XML configuration code here (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/applying-more-than-just-tx-advice.html>) "
"How can you change the order of execution for the profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot?","To change the order of execution for the profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot, you can modify the order property of the SimpleProfiler bean. If you want the profiling advice to run after the transactional advice on the way in and before the transactional advice on the way out, you can swap the value of the profiling aspect bean’s order property so that it is higher than the transactional advice’s order value. The following configuration demonstrates this change: XML configuration code here (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/applying-more-than-just-tx-advice.html>) "
"How can you use the Spring Framework's @Transactional support outside of a Spring container?","You can use the Spring Framework’s @Transactional support outside of a Spring container by means of an AspectJ aspect. First, annotate your classes (and optionally your classes' methods) with the @Transactional annotation, and then link (weave) your application with the org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect defined in the spring-aspects.jar file. You must also configure the aspect with a transaction manager. The simplest way to configure the transaction management aspect is to use the <tx:annotation-driven/> element and specify the mode attribute to aspectj. For more information, see the Spring Framework reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/aspectj.html"
"What is the importance of configuring the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use a transaction manager before executing any transactional methods?","Configuring the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use a transaction manager before executing any transactional methods is crucial because it enables the AspectJ aspect to manage transactions properly. The transaction manager is responsible for coordinating transactions, and without it, the aspect would not be able to handle transactional operations correctly. For more information, see the Spring Framework reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/aspectj.html"
"What is the difference between annotating a class with @Transactional and annotating a method within that class?","Annotating a class with @Transactional specifies the default transaction semantics for the execution of any public method in the class. On the other hand, annotating a method within the class with @Transactional overrides the default transaction semantics given by the class annotation. You can annotate any method, regardless of visibility. For more information, see the Spring Framework reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/aspectj.html"
"What are the two means of programmatic transaction management provided by the Spring Framework?","The two means of programmatic transaction management provided by the Spring Framework are using the TransactionTemplate or TransactionalOperator directly or using a TransactionManager implementation directly.

"What is the recommended approach for programmatic transaction management in reactive code?","The recommended approach for programmatic transaction management in reactive code is to use the TransactionalOperator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/programmatic.html)"
"In what scenarios is programmatic transaction management a good choice according to the provided information?","Programmatic transaction management is usually a good idea only if you have a small number of transactional operations, such as a web application that requires transactions only for certain update operations. In this case, using the TransactionTemplate may be a good approach. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-decl-vs-prog.html)"
"What are the benefits of using declarative transaction management over programmatic transaction management in the context of numerous transactional operations?","Declarative transaction management is usually worthwhile if your application has numerous transactional operations. It keeps transaction management out of business logic and is not difficult to configure. When using the Spring Framework, rather than EJB CMT, the configuration cost of declarative transaction management is greatly reduced. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-decl-vs-prog.html)"
"What is the advantage of using the programmatic approach to transaction management in terms of setting the transaction name?","Being able to set the transaction name explicitly is something that can be done only by using the programmatic approach to transaction management. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-decl-vs-prog.html)"
"What is the purpose of binding a Spring event listener to a transaction phase?","The purpose of binding a Spring event listener to a transaction phase is to allow the listener to handle the event only when the transaction has completed successfully. This can be done using the @TransactionalEventListener annotation, which binds the listener to the commit phase of the transaction by default. The phase attribute of the annotation can be used to customize the transaction phase to which the listener should be bound. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/event.html)"
"How can you set up an event listener that handles an event only after the transaction in which it was published has committed successfully?","To set up an event listener that handles an event only after the transaction in which it was published has committed successfully, you can use the @TransactionalEventListener annotation on the listener method. This annotation binds the listener to the commit phase of the transaction by default. For example, in Java, you can use the following code: @Component public class MyComponent { @TransactionalEventListener public void handleOrderCreatedEvent(CreationEvent<Order> creationEvent) { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/event.html)"
"What are the valid transaction phases that can be used with the @TransactionalEventListener annotation?","The valid transaction phases that can be used with the @TransactionalEventListener annotation are BEFORE_COMMIT, AFTER_COMMIT (default), AFTER_ROLLBACK, and AFTER_COMPLETION, which aggregates the transaction completion (be it a commit or a rollback). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/event.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's JtaTransactionManager and how does it enhance transaction semantics?","Spring's JtaTransactionManager is the standard choice to run on Jakarta EE application servers and is known to work on all common servers. It autodetects the location for the JTA TransactionManager object, which varies by application server. Having access to the JTA TransactionManager allows for enhanced transaction semantics, including supporting transaction suspension. This advanced functionality works on many servers without any special configuration required. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/JtaTransactionManager.html)"
"What is the significance of application server-specific integration in Spring's transaction abstraction?","Spring's transaction abstraction is generally application server-agnostic, meaning it can work with various application servers. However, some features, like transaction suspension, require access to the JTA TransactionManager, which varies by application server. The JtaTransactionManager class in Spring can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA UserTransaction and TransactionManager objects, autodetecting their location. This integration allows for advanced transaction management capabilities. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/application-server-integration.html)"
"What is the role of JNDI lookup in Spring's JtaTransactionManager and how does it help with transaction management?","The JtaTransactionManager class in Spring can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA UserTransaction and TransactionManager objects. JNDI lookup is a process that allows applications to locate and access resources, such as databases, message queues, and transaction managers, by name. By performing a JNDI lookup, Spring's JtaTransactionManager can autodetect the location of the JTA TransactionManager object, which varies by application server. This integration helps with transaction management by providing enhanced transaction semantics, including transaction suspension, and advanced functionality that works on many servers without any special configuration required.

"What is the purpose of DAO support in Spring?","The purpose of DAO support in Spring is to make it easy to work with data access technologies in a consistent way, allowing you to switch between them easily and code without worrying about catching exceptions specific to each technology. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/dao.html)"
"How does Spring handle technology-specific exceptions in its exception class hierarchy?","Spring provides a convenient translation from technology-specific exceptions to its own exception class hierarchy, which has DataAccessException as the root exception. These exceptions wrap the original exception, ensuring that you never lose any information about what might have gone wrong. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/dao.html)"
"What is the best way to configure DAO or repository classes in Spring?","The best way to configure DAO or repository classes in Spring is to use the @Repository annotation.

"Which actions related to JDBC are the responsibility of the user when using Spring Framework?","The user is responsible for defining connection parameters, specifying the SQL statement, declaring parameters and providing parameter values, setting up the loop to iterate through the results (if any), doing the work for each iteration, processing any exception, and handling transactions. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc.html})"
"What actions related to JDBC does Spring Framework handle?","Spring Framework handles opening the connection, preparing and running the statement, and closing the connection, the statement, and the resultset. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc.html})"
"What are the different approaches for JDBC database access in Spring?","The different approaches for JDBC database access in Spring include JdbcTemplate, NamedParameterJdbcTemplate, SimpleJdbcInsert, SimpleJdbcCall, and RDBMS objects like MappingSqlQuery, SqlUpdate, and StoredProcedure. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/choose-style.html)"
"What is the difference between JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate?","JdbcTemplate is a low-level approach that uses traditional JDBC ? placeholders, while NamedParameterJdbcTemplate wraps JdbcTemplate and provides named parameters for better documentation and ease of use when dealing with multiple parameters in an SQL statement. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/choose-style.html)"
"How does the SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall approach simplify coding?","The SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall approach simplifies coding by optimizing database metadata, allowing you to only provide the name of the table or procedure and a map of parameters matching the column names. This approach works best when the database provides adequate metadata. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/choose-style.html)"
"What is the main class in the org.springframework.jdbc.core package and what does it do?","The main class in the org.springframework.jdbc.core package is the JdbcTemplate class. It provides a high-level wrapper around JDBC that simplifies basic JDBC processing and error handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/packages.html)"
"What is the purpose of the org.springframework.jdbc.datasource package?","The org.springframework.jdbc.datasource package contains a utility class for easy DataSource access and various simple DataSource implementations that you can use for testing and running unmodified JDBC code outside of a Jakarta EE container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/packages.html)"
"What does the org.springframework.jdbc.support package provide?","The org.springframework.jdbc.support package provides SQLException translation functionality and some utility classes. Exceptions thrown during JDBC processing are translated to exceptions defined in the org.springframework.dao package, which allows for unchecked exceptions and simplifies error handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/packages.html)"
"How can I use JdbcTemplate to control basic JDBC processing and error handling in Spring Boot?","You can use JdbcTemplate to control basic JDBC processing and error handling in Spring Boot by using its methods to run SQL queries, update statements, and stored procedures, as well as handle exception translation. JdbcTemplate handles the creation and release of resources, which helps you avoid common errors such as forgetting to close the connection. It performs the basic tasks of the core JDBC workflow (such as statement creation and execution), leaving application code to provide SQL and extract results. It also catches JDBC exceptions and translates them to the generic, more informative, exception hierarchy defined in the org.springframework.dao package. See the official documentation for more information: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/core.html"
"What is the difference between using JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate in Spring Boot?","The main difference between using JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate in Spring Boot is that JdbcTemplate uses placeholder (?) arguments, while NamedParameterJdbcTemplate uses named parameters. NamedParameterJdbcTemplate provides support for programming JDBC statements by using named parameters, which can make your code more readable and easier to maintain. It wraps a JdbcTemplate and delegates to the wrapped JdbcTemplate to do much of its work. See the official documentation for more information: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/core.html#jdbc-NamedParameterJdbcTemplate"
"How can I use JdbcClient for unified JDBC query/update operations in Spring Boot?","You can use JdbcClient for unified JDBC query/update operations in Spring Boot by creating a JdbcClient instance with the JdbcClient.create(dataSource) method, where dataSource is your DataSource. Then, you can use the fluent API provided by JdbcClient to define your SQL statements, set parameters, and execute queries or updates. JdbcClient provides convenient methods for querying and updating data, as well as support for row mapping and result resolution. See the official documentation for more information: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/core.html#jdbc-JdbcClient"
"What is a DataSource and what is its purpose in Spring?","A DataSource is part of the JDBC specification and is a generalized connection factory. It lets a container or a framework hide connection pooling and transaction management issues from the application code. In Spring, a DataSource is used to obtain a connection to the database. The purpose of a DataSource is to provide a way for developers to obtain a connection to the database without needing to know the details of how the connection is pooled or managed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/connections.html)"
"What are some advantages of using a DataSource in Spring?","Using a DataSource in Spring provides several advantages, including hiding connection pooling and transaction management issues, allowing for easy testing of code outside an application server, and reusing the same connection all the time to avoid excessive creation of physical connections. Additionally, DataSource supports savepoints, custom isolation levels, and timeouts that get applied as appropriate JDBC statement query timeouts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/connections.html)"
"What is the purpose of the DriverManagerDataSource class in Spring?","The DriverManagerDataSource class is an implementation of the standard DataSource interface that configures a plain JDBC driver through bean properties and returns a new Connection every time. This implementation is useful for test and stand-alone environments outside of a Jakarta EE container, either as a DataSource bean in a Spring IoC container or in conjunction with a simple JNDI environment. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/connections.html)"
"What is the purpose of batch operations in JDBC?","Batch operations in JDBC provide improved performance by grouping multiple updates into batches, which limits the number of round trips to the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/advanced.html)"
"How can you accomplish JdbcTemplate batch processing?","JdbcTemplate batch processing is accomplished by implementing two methods of a special interface, BatchPreparedStatementSetter, and passing that implementation in as the second parameter in your batchUpdate method call. You can use the getBatchSize method to provide the size of the current batch and the setValues method to set the values for the parameters of the prepared statement. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/advanced.html)"
"What is the purpose of the InterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter interface?","The InterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter interface allows you to interrupt a batch once the input source is exhausted. The isBatchExhausted method lets you signal the end of the batch. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/advanced.html)"
"What are the benefits of using the SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall classes for JDBC operations in Spring?","The SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall classes provide a simplified configuration by taking advantage of database metadata that can be retrieved through the JDBC driver. This means that you have less to configure up front, although you can override or turn off the metadata processing if you prefer to provide all the details in your code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/simple.html)"
"How do you use the SimpleJdbcInsert class to insert data into a table?","To insert data using the SimpleJdbcInsert class, you should instantiate the SimpleJdbcInsert in the data access layer’s initialization method. You do not need to subclass the SimpleJdbcInsert class. Instead, you can create a new instance and set the table name by using the withTableName method. The execute method used here takes a plain java.util.Map as its only parameter. The important thing to note here is that the keys used for the Map must match the column names of the table, as defined in the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/simple.html)"
"How can you retrieve auto-generated keys when using the SimpleJdbcInsert class?","To retrieve auto-generated keys using the SimpleJdbcInsert class, you specify the name of the generated key column with the usingGeneratedKeyColumns method when creating the SimpleJdbcInsert. The executeAndReturnKey method is then used to execute the insert and return the auto-generated key. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/simple.html)"
"What is the purpose of the org.springframework.jdbc.object package in Spring Boot?","The org.springframework.jdbc.object package contains classes that let you access the database in a more object-oriented manner. It provides a way to run queries, get results as a list of business objects, and run stored procedures and update, delete, and insert statements. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/object.html)"
"What is the role of the SqlQuery class in Spring Boot?","The SqlQuery class is a reusable, thread-safe class that encapsulates an SQL query. Subclasses must implement the newRowMapper(..) method to provide a RowMapper instance that can create one object per row obtained from iterating over the ResultSet that is created during the execution of the query. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/object.html)"
"How can you map rows to Java classes using the MappingSqlQuery class in Spring Boot?","The MappingSqlQuery class is a subclass of SqlQuery that provides a more convenient implementation for mapping rows to Java classes. Subclasses must implement the abstract mapRow(..) method to convert each row of the supplied ResultSet into an object of the type specified. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/object.html)"
"How can you provide SQL type information for parameters when using Spring Framework's JDBC support?","You can provide SQL type information in several ways: Many update and query methods of the JdbcTemplate take an additional parameter in the form of an int array. This array is used to indicate the SQL type of the corresponding parameter by using constant values from the java.sql.Types class. Provide one entry for each parameter. You can use the SqlParameterValue class to wrap the parameter value that needs this additional information. To do so, create a new instance for each value and pass in the SQL type and the parameter value in the constructor. You can also provide an optional scale parameter for numeric values. For methods that work with named parameters, you can use the SqlParameterSource classes, BeanPropertySqlParameterSource or MapSqlParameterSource. They both have methods for registering the SQL type for any of the named parameter values. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/parameter-handling.html>)"
"How can you handle BLOB and CLOB objects when using Spring Framework's JDBC support?","You can handle these large objects by using the JdbcTemplate directly and also when using the higher abstractions provided by RDBMS Objects and the SimpleJdbc classes. All of these approaches use an implementation of the LobHandler interface for the actual management of the LOB (Large OBject) data. LobHandler provides access to a LobCreator class, through the getLobCreator method, that is used for creating new LOB objects to be inserted. LobCreator and LobHandler provide support for BLOB and CLOB input and output, including methods like getBlobAsBytes, setBlobAsBytes, getBlobAsBinaryStream, setBlobAsBinaryStream, getClobAsString, setClobAsString, getClobAsAsciiStream, setClobAsAsciiStream, getClobAsCharacterStream, and setClobAsCharacterStream. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/parameter-handling.html>)"
"How can you pass in a list of values for an IN clause when using Spring Framework's JDBC support?","You can pass in the values as a java.util.List (or any Iterable) of simple values. This list is used to insert the required placeholders into the actual SQL statement and pass in the values during statement execution. Be careful when passing in many values. The JDBC standard does not guarantee that you can use more than 100 values for an IN expression list. Various databases exceed this number, but they usually have a hard limit for how many values are allowed. For example, Oracle's limit is 1000. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/parameter-handling.html>)"
"What are the benefits of using an embedded database during the development phase of a project?","Benefits include ease of configuration, quick startup time, testability, and the ability to rapidly evolve your SQL during development.

"What is the recommended integration style for coding DAOs with Hibernate in Spring?","The recommended integration style is to code DAOs against plain Hibernate or JPA APIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/introduction.html)"
"How does Spring simplify testing of persistence-related code?","Spring's IoC approach makes it easy to swap the implementations and configuration locations of Hibernate SessionFactory instances, JDBC DataSource instances, transaction managers, and mapped object implementations (if needed), which in turn makes it much easier to test each piece of persistence-related code in isolation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's conversion of ORM exceptions to a common runtime DataAccessException hierarchy?","Spring can wrap exceptions from your ORM tool, converting them from proprietary (potentially checked) exceptions to a common runtime DataAccessException hierarchy. This feature lets you handle most persistence exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the appropriate layers, without annoying boilerplate catches, throws, and exception declarations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/introduction.html)"
"What is the primary aim of Spring's ORM integration?","The major goal of Spring’s ORM integration is clear application layering (with any data access and transaction technology) and for loose coupling of application objects — no more business service dependencies on the data access or transaction strategy, no more hard-coded resource lookups, no more hard-to-replace singletons, no more custom service registries.

"What is the difference between AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer and AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer in Spring MVC?","AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer is recommended for applications that use Java-based Spring configuration, while AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer is used for applications that use XML-based Spring configuration. Both classes make it easier to register the DispatcherServlet and provide a convenient way to add filters and customize the DispatcherServlet. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/container-config.html)"
"What is the role of the WebApplicationContext in the DispatcherServlet request processing?","The WebApplicationContext is searched for and bound in the request as an attribute that the controller and other elements in the process can use. It is bound by default under the DispatcherServlet.WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE key. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/sequence.html)"
"What is the purpose of the locale resolver in the DispatcherServlet request processing?","The locale resolver is bound to the request to let elements in the process resolve the locale to use when processing the request (rendering the view, preparing data, and so on). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/sequence.html)"
"How can a handler be searched for in the DispatcherServlet request processing?","An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain associated with the handler (preprocessors, postprocessors, and controllers) is run to prepare a model for rendering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/sequence.html)"
"What is the issue with relying on the servletPath in Spring MVC?","The servletPath comes with the prefix-based servletPath mapping type, which can introduce issues such as the servletPath being normalized to varying degrees by Servlet containers, making it impossible to perform startsWith comparisons against the requestURI. This is why it is best to avoid reliance on the servletPath. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-path.html)"
"How can the issue of decoding the requestURI be resolved in Spring MVC?","The issue of decoding the requestURI can be resolved by using PathPatternParser and parsed patterns, which matches to a parsed representation of the path called RequestPath, one path segment at a time. This allows decoding and sanitizing path segment values individually without the risk of altering the structure of the path. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-path.html)"
"What is the advantage of using PathPatternParser in Spring MVC?","PathPatternParser has the advantage of matching to a parsed representation of the path called RequestPath, one path segment at a time. This allows decoding and sanitizing path segment values individually without the risk of altering the structure of the path. It also supports the use of servletPath prefix mapping as long as a Servlet path mapping is used and the prefix is kept simple, i.e. it has no encoded characters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-path.html)"
"What is the purpose of handler interception in Spring Boot?","Handler interception is useful when you want to apply functionality across requests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-interceptor.html)"
"What is the role of the preHandle method in a HandlerInterceptor?","The preHandle method is a callback before the actual handler is run that returns a boolean. If the method returns true, execution continues; if it returns false, the rest of the execution chain is bypassed and the handler is not called. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-interceptor.html)"
"How can you modify the response after the handler has run?","You can implement ResponseBodyAdvice and declare it as a Controller Advice bean or configure it directly on RequestMappingHandlerAdapter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-interceptor.html)"
"What is the purpose of HandlerExceptionResolver beans in the DispatcherServlet?","HandlerExceptionResolver beans in the DispatcherServlet are responsible for resolving exceptions that occur during request mapping or are thrown from a request handler, typically providing an alternative handling, such as an error response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.html)"
"What is the difference between SimpleMappingExceptionResolver and DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver?","SimpleMappingExceptionResolver is a mapping between exception class names and error view names, useful for rendering error pages in a browser application. DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver resolves exceptions raised by Spring MVC and maps them to HTTP status codes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.html)"
"How can you customize the list of HandlerExceptionResolver beans in your Spring configuration?","You can customize the list of HandlerExceptionResolver beans in your Spring configuration by declaring multiple HandlerExceptionResolver beans and setting their order properties as needed. The higher the order property, the later the exception resolver is positioned in the chain. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ViewResolver interface in Spring MVC?","The ViewResolver interface in Spring MVC provides a mapping between view names and actual views. It addresses the preparation of data before handing over to a specific view technology. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.html)"
"What is the difference between UrlBasedViewResolver and InternalResourceViewResolver?","UrlBasedViewResolver is a simple implementation of the ViewResolver interface that effects the direct resolution of logical view names to URLs without an explicit mapping definition. InternalResourceViewResolver is a convenient subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports InternalResourceView and subclasses such as JstlView, and can be used to specify the view class for all views generated by this resolver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.html)"
"How can you configure view resolution in Spring MVC?","Configuring view resolution in Spring MVC is as simple as adding ViewResolver beans to your Spring configuration. The MVC Config provides a dedicated configuration API for View Resolvers and for adding logic-less View Controllers which are useful for HTML template rendering without controller logic. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.html)"
"How does Spring's architecture support internationalization in the Spring web MVC framework?","Spring's architecture supports internationalization by allowing most parts of the framework to handle internationalization, including the Spring web MVC framework. DispatcherServlet automatically resolves messages using the client's locale with LocaleResolver objects. The locale can be retrieved using the RequestContext.getLocale() method. In addition to automatic locale resolution, interceptors can be used to change the locale under specific circumstances. Locale resolvers and interceptors are defined in the org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n package and are configured in the application context. The following selection of locale resolvers is included in Spring: Time Zone, Header Resolver, Cookie Resolver, Session Resolver, and Locale Interceptor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/localeresolver.html)"
"How can you obtain the client's time zone in addition to the locale in the Spring web MVC framework?","To obtain the client's time zone in addition to the locale, you can use the LocaleContextResolver interface, which extends LocaleResolver and provides a richer LocaleContext that may include time zone information. The user's TimeZone can be obtained using the RequestContext.getTimeZone() method. Time zone information is automatically used by any Date/Time Converter and Formatter objects registered with Spring's ConversionService. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/localeresolver.html)"
"How does the CookieLocaleResolver work in the Spring web MVC framework, and what properties can be configured for it?","The CookieLocaleResolver inspects a Cookie on the client to see if a Locale or TimeZone is specified. It uses the specified details if available. Properties that can be configured for the CookieLocaleResolver include the cookie name and maximum age, as well as the cookie path. The following example defines a CookieLocaleResolver with a cookie name of 'clientlanguage' and a cookie maximum age of 100,000 seconds: <bean id='localeResolver' class='org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.CookieLocaleResolver'> <property name='cookieName' value='clientlanguage'/> <property name='cookieMaxAge' value='100000'/> </bean> The following table describes the properties of CookieLocaleResolver: Table 1. CookieLocaleResolver properties Property Default Description cookieName class name + LOCALE The name of the cookie cookieMaxAge Servlet container default The maximum time a cookie persists on the client. If set to -1, the cookie will not be persisted. It is available only until the client shuts down the browser. cookiePath / Limits the visibility of the cookie to a certain part of your site. When cookiePath is specified, the cookie is visible only to that path and the paths below it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/localeresolver.html)"
"What is the purpose of a theme in the Spring Web MVC framework?","A theme in the Spring Web MVC framework is used to set the overall look-and-feel of your application, thereby enhancing user experience. It is a collection of static resources, typically style sheets and images, that affect the visual style of the application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.html)"
"How do you define a theme in your web application using the Spring Web MVC framework?","To use themes in your web application, you must set up an implementation of the org.springframework.ui.context.ThemeSource interface. The WebApplicationContext interface extends ThemeSource but delegates its responsibilities to a dedicated implementation. By default, the delegate is an org.springframework.ui.context.support.ResourceBundleThemeSource implementation that loads properties files from the root of the classpath. To use a custom ThemeSource implementation or to configure the base name prefix of the ResourceBundleThemeSource , you can register a bean in the application context with the reserved name, themeSource . The web application context automatically detects a bean with that name and uses it. When you use the ResourceBundleThemeSource , a theme is defined in a simple properties file. The properties file lists the resources that make up the theme, as the following example shows: styleSheet=/themes/cool/style.css background=/themes/cool/img/coolBg.jpg The keys of the properties are the names that refer to the themed elements from view code. For a JSP, you typically do this using the spring:theme custom tag, which is very similar to the spring:message tag. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.html)"
"How do you resolve themes in the Spring Web MVC framework?","After you define themes, as described in the preceding section, you decide which theme to use. The DispatcherServlet looks for a bean named themeResolver to find out which ThemeResolver implementation to use. A theme resolver works in much the same way as a LocaleResolver . It detects the theme to use for a particular request and can also alter the request’s theme. The following table describes the theme resolvers provided by Spring: Table 1. ThemeResolver implementations Class Description FixedThemeResolver Selects a fixed theme, set by using the defaultThemeName property. SessionThemeResolver The theme is maintained in the user’s HTTP session. It needs to be set only once for each session but is not persisted between sessions. CookieThemeResolver The selected theme is stored in a cookie on the client. Spring also provides a ThemeChangeInterceptor that lets theme changes on every request with a simple request parameter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.html)"
"What is MultipartResolver in Spring Framework and what does it do?","MultipartResolver in Spring Framework is a strategy for parsing multipart requests including file uploads. It is used to handle multipart requests and expose files in addition to request parameters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/multipart.html)"
"What is the difference between StandardServletMultipartResolver and CommonsMultipartResolver in Spring Framework?","StandardServletMultipartResolver is a container-based implementation for Servlet multipart request parsing, while CommonsMultipartResolver was based on Apache Commons FileUpload. CommonsMultipartResolver is not available anymore as of Spring Framework 6.0, but StandardServletMultipartResolver is still available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/multipart.html)"
"How can you enable Servlet multipart parsing in Spring Framework?","To enable Servlet multipart parsing in Spring Framework, you can set a MultipartConfigElement on the Servlet registration in Java or add a '<multipart-config>' section to the servlet declaration in web.xml. This can be done by creating a bean of type StandardServletMultipartResolver with a name of multipartResolver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/multipart.html)"
"What are the goals of DEBUG-level logging in Spring MVC?","The goals of DEBUG-level logging in Spring MVC are to provide compact, minimal, and human-friendly information that is useful over and over again. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/logging.html)"
"What is the difference between DEBUG and TRACE logging levels in Spring MVC?","Both DEBUG and TRACE logging levels in Spring MVC follow similar principles, but TRACE-level logging can be used for debugging any issue and may show a different level of detail compared to DEBUG. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/logging.html)"
"How can sensitive information be protected when enabling DEBUG and TRACE logging in Spring MVC?","To protect sensitive information when enabling DEBUG and TRACE logging in Spring MVC, request parameters and headers are masked by default. Their logging in full must be enabled explicitly through the enableLoggingRequestDetails property on DispatcherServlet using Java configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/logging.html)"
"What is FormContentFilter and when is it used?","FormContentFilter is a filter provided by the spring-web module that intercepts HTTP PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests with a content type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded. It reads the form data from the body of the request and wraps the ServletRequest to make the form data available through the ServletRequest.getParameter*() family of methods. This is useful because browsers can only submit form data through HTTP GET or HTTP POST, but non-browser clients can use other methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-http-put)"
"What are non-standard headers used for communication in proxies and what are some examples?","Non-standard headers, such as X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Ssl, and X-Forwarded-Prefix, are used to communicate information about the original request to a downstream server. For example, X-Forwarded-Host communicates the original host, X-Forwarded-Port communicates the original port, and X-Forwarded-Proto communicates the original protocol. These headers can be used to create links that point to the correct host, port, and scheme from a client perspective when going through proxies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-forwarded-headers)"
"What is the ShallowEtagHeaderFilter and how does it work?","The ShallowEtagHeaderFilter is a filter that creates a 'shallow' ETag by caching the content written to the response and computing an MD5 hash from it. When a client sends an If-None-Match request header, the filter compares the computed value against the header and returns a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) if the two are equal. This strategy saves network bandwidth but not CPU, as the full response must be computed for each request. The filter has a writeWeakETag parameter that configures the filter to write weak ETags. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-shallow-etag)"
"What is the annotation-based programming model in Spring MVC?","The annotation-based programming model in Spring MVC is a way to define controllers using annotations such as @Controller and @RestController. This model allows for flexible method signatures and does not require extending base classes or implementing specific interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller.html)"
"What are the advantages of using annotated controllers in Spring MVC?","The advantages of using annotated controllers in Spring MVC include flexible method signatures, no need to extend base classes or implement specific interfaces, and the ability to express request mappings, request input, exception handling, and more using annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller.html)"
"What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController annotations in Spring MVC?","@Controller is used for traditional web applications, while @RestController is used for RESTful web services. The main difference is that @RestController automatically adds the @ResponseBody annotation to the controller methods, which means that the method return value is directly serialized and returned in the HTTP response body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller.html)"
"How can you define controller beans in Spring Boot using Java configuration?","You can define controller beans in Spring Boot using Java configuration by adding component scanning to your configuration, as shown in the following example: Java Kotlin @Configuration @ComponentScan(""org.example.web"") public class WebConfig { // ... } @Configuration @ComponentScan(""org.example.web"") class WebConfig { // ... } (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann.html>)"
"What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController annotations in Spring Boot?","@Controller is a stereotype annotation that allows for auto-detection of controller beans, while @RestController is a composed annotation that inherits from @Controller and @ResponseBody, indicating a controller whose every method writes directly to the response body. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann.html>) "
"What is the recommended approach for AOP proxying in Spring Boot controllers?","For controllers specifically, it is recommended to use class-based proxying. If the controller implements an interface and needs AOP proxying, you may need to explicitly configure class-based proxying. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann.html>) "
"What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Spring MVC?","The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map requests to controller methods in Spring MVC. It has various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media types. It can be used at the class level to express shared mappings or at the method level to narrow down to a specific endpoint mapping. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"How can I specify the HTTP methods that a controller method should handle using @RequestMapping?","You can use the HTTP method-specific shortcut variants of @RequestMapping, such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping, to specify the HTTP methods that a controller method should handle. These shortcuts are provided because most controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"How can I narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request?","To narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request, you can use the consumes attribute in the @RequestMapping annotation or its method-specific shortcut variants. The consumes attribute allows you to specify the content types that the controller method can consume. You can also use negation expressions to specify content types that the method cannot consume. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"What is the name of the section that discusses the flexible signature of @RequestMapping handler methods and the range of supported controller method arguments and return values?","Section Summary (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods.html)"

"What is the purpose of the WebRequest and NativeWebRequest arguments in a Spring MVC controller method?","The WebRequest and NativeWebRequest arguments provide generic access to request parameters and request and session attributes without directly using the Servlet API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"What is the difference between the HttpMethod argument and the java.util.Locale argument in a Spring MVC controller method?","The HttpMethod argument represents the HTTP method of the request, while the java.util.Locale argument represents the current request locale determined by the most specific LocaleResolver available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestBody and HttpEntity<B> arguments in a Spring MVC controller method?","The @RequestBody argument is used for accessing the HTTP request body, while the HttpEntity<B> argument is used for accessing request headers and body. The body is converted with an HttpMessageConverter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @ResponseBody annotation in Spring MVC?","The @ResponseBody annotation converts the return value of a controller method through HttpMessageConverter implementations and writes it to the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpEntity and ResponseEntity in Spring MVC?","HttpEntity specifies the full response, including HTTP headers and body, while ResponseEntity is a more specific version of HttpEntity that can be used to return a response with headers and body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What is the purpose of the HttpHeaders class in Spring MVC?","The HttpHeaders class is used for returning a response with headers and no body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What are the annotated controller method arguments that represent String-based request input in Spring Boot?","@RequestParam, @RequestHeader, @PathVariable, @MatrixVariable, and @CookieValue (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"How can you customize type conversion in Spring Boot?","Through a WebDataBinder (see DataBinder(../ann-initbinder.html)) or by registering Formatters with the FormattingConversionService.

This can be the case for Long, UUID, and other target types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"What is the purpose of matrix variables in Spring MVC?","Matrix variables in Spring MVC are used to handle name-value pairs in path segments. They can be referred to as URI path parameters and can appear in any path segment, separated by a semicolon. Multiple values can be separated by a comma or repeated variable names can be used to specify multiple values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html)"
"How can you disambiguate which path variable a matrix variable is expected to be in?","To disambiguate which path variable a matrix variable is expected to be in, you can use the @MatrixVariable annotation with the name and pathVar attributes. This allows you to specify the name of the matrix variable and the path variable it is expected to be in. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html)"
"How can you define a matrix variable as optional and specify a default value?","To define a matrix variable as optional and specify a default value, you can use the @MatrixVariable annotation with the required and defaultValue attributes. Setting required to false makes the matrix variable optional, and defaultValue specifies the default value to be used if the matrix variable is not present. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestParam annotation in Spring Boot?","The @RequestParam annotation is used to bind Servlet request parameters (query parameters or form data) to a method argument in a controller. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can you make a method parameter optional using the @RequestParam annotation?","You can make a method parameter optional by setting the @RequestParam annotation's required flag to false or by declaring the argument with a java.util.Optional wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"Is type conversion automatically applied when using the @RequestParam annotation?","Yes, type conversion is automatically applied if the target method parameter type is not String. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can I bind a request header to a method argument in a Spring Boot controller?","You can use the @RequestHeader annotation to bind a request header to a method argument in a Spring Boot controller.

"How does the @ModelAttribute annotation work in Spring MVC?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC binds request parameters onto a model object. It can bind to an instance of a specified class, which can be accessed from the model, HTTP session, or obtained through a Converter. The model object can be customized with constructor or property data binding, and security considerations should be taken into account. When using constructor binding, request parameter names can be customized with the @BindParam annotation. The @ModelAttribute annotation is optional, but it's recommended to use it for GraalVM native images. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How can I handle validation errors when using @ModelAttribute in Spring MVC?","To handle validation errors when using @ModelAttribute in Spring MVC, you can add a BindingResult argument immediately next to the @ModelAttribute in the controller method. This will allow you to handle the errors in the controller method. Alternatively, you can use the @Validated annotation to automatically apply validation after data binding. If there is no BindingResult parameter after the @ModelAttribute, then MethodArgumentNotValueException is raised with the validation errors. If method validation applies because other parameters have @jakarta.validation.Constraint annotations, then HandlerMethodValidationException is raised instead. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How can I access a model attribute without data binding in Spring MVC?","To access a model attribute without data binding in Spring MVC, you can inject the Model into the controller and access it directly. Alternatively, you can set @ModelAttribute(binding=false) on the model attribute to prevent data binding. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot?","The @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot is used to store model attributes in the HTTP Servlet session between requests. It declares the session attributes used by a specific controller and typically lists the names or types of model attributes that should be stored in the session for subsequent requests to access. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How is a model attribute with the name 'pet' stored in the HTTP Servlet session using the @SessionAttributes annotation?","In a controller class annotated with @SessionAttributes('pet'), when a model attribute with the name 'pet' is added to the model on the first request, it is automatically saved in the HTTP Servlet session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How can the model attribute 'pet' be cleared from the HTTP Servlet session using the @SessionAttributes annotation?","The model attribute 'pet' can be cleared from the HTTP Servlet session by using a SessionStatus method argument in a controller method and calling the setComplete() method on the SessionStatus object. This will remove the 'pet' attribute from the session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"What happens to all model attributes by default when a redirect is performed in Spring MVC?","By default, all model attributes are considered to be exposed as URI template variables in the redirect URL.

"What is the purpose of using a @RequestMapping method with an argument of type RedirectAttributes?","A @RequestMapping method can declare an argument of type RedirectAttributes and use it to specify the exact attributes to make available to RedirectView. This is useful to avoid having additional attributes added for rendering purposes appear in the URL. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/redirecting-passing-data.html)"
"What is the purpose of flash attributes in Spring MVC?","Flash attributes provide a way for one request to store attributes that are intended for use in another, most commonly needed when redirecting. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.html)"
"How are flash attributes managed in Spring MVC?","Spring MVC has two main abstractions in support of flash attributes: FlashMap is used to hold flash attributes, while FlashMapManager is used to store, retrieve, and manage FlashMap instances. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.html)"
"How can concurrency issues be reduced when using flash attributes in Spring MVC?","RedirectView automatically ‘stamps’ FlashMap instances with the path and query parameters of the target redirect URL, which reduces the possibility of concurrency issues by matching that information to incoming requests when it looks up the ‘input’ FlashMap. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.html)"
"How can you access multiple uploaded files in a Spring Boot controller?","You can access multiple uploaded files in a Spring Boot controller by declaring the argument type as a List<MultipartFile>, which allows for resolving multiple files for the same parameter name. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html>)"
"How can you access multipart data in a Spring Boot controller as part of data binding to a command object?","You can access multipart data in a Spring Boot controller as part of data binding to a command object by declaring the form field and file from the preceding example as fields on a form object, as shown in the example provided. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html>)"
"How can you handle validation errors for multipart data in a Spring Boot controller?","You can handle validation errors for multipart data in a Spring Boot controller by using @RequestPart in combination with jakarta.validation.Valid or Spring's @Validated annotation, which causes Standard Bean Validation to be applied. By default, validation errors cause a MethodArgumentNotValidException, which is turned into a 400 (BAD_REQUEST) response. Alternatively, you can handle validation errors locally within the controller through an Errors or BindingResult argument, as shown in the example provided. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestBody annotation in Spring Boot?","The @RequestBody annotation is used to have the request body read and deserialized into an Object through an HttpMessageConverter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"How can you configure or customize message conversion in Spring Boot?","You can use the Message Converters option of the MVC Config to configure or customize message conversion. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"Can you use the @RequestBody annotation to read form data in Spring Boot?","No, you should use the @RequestParam annotation to read form data, not @RequestBody, as @RequestBody can't always be used reliably and can cause issues with parsing the request body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpEntity and @RequestBody in Spring Boot?","HttpEntity is more or less identical to using @RequestBody but is based on a container object that exposes request headers and body. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html})"
"How can I handle HTTP requests with HttpEntity in a Spring Boot controller?","To handle HTTP requests with HttpEntity in a Spring Boot controller, you can use the @PostMapping annotation and define a method that takes an HttpEntity object as a parameter. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html})"
"How can I access the request body and headers in a Spring Boot controller using HttpEntity?","To access the request body and headers in a Spring Boot controller using HttpEntity, you can use the getBody() and getHeaders() methods on the HttpEntity object. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html})"
"What is the purpose of the @ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot?","The @ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot is used on a method to have the return serialized to the response body through an HttpMessageConverter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"Can the @ResponseBody annotation be used at the class level in Spring Boot?","Yes, the @ResponseBody annotation can be used at the class level in Spring Boot, in which case it is inherited by all controller methods. This is the effect of @RestController, which is a meta-annotation marked with @Controller and @ResponseBody. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"How can you use the @ResponseBody annotation with reactive types in Spring Boot?","You can use the @ResponseBody annotation with reactive types in Spring Boot.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"What is the difference between ResponseEntity and @ResponseBody in Spring Boot?","ResponseEntity is similar to @ResponseBody but provides additional functionality for setting status and headers. It is used to return a response entity with a specific status code and headers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How can I return a ResponseEntity with a specific body and headers in a Spring Boot controller method?","You can return a ResponseEntity with a specific body and headers by using the ResponseEntity.ok() method and providing the body and headers as parameters. For example: return ResponseEntity.ok().eTag(etag).body(body); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"Can I use a reactive type to produce a ResponseEntity asynchronously in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can use a single value reactive type to produce the ResponseEntity asynchronously in Spring Boot. This allows you to set the response status and headers immediately while the body is provided asynchronously at a later point. You can use Mono if the body consists of 0..1 values or Flux if it can produce multiple values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How does Spring MVC provide support for Jackson's Serialization Views?","Spring MVC provides built-in support for Jackson's Serialization Views, which allow rendering only a subset of all fields in an Object. This can be achieved by using Jackson's @JsonView annotation to activate a serialization view class."
"What is the purpose of the @JsonView annotation in Spring MVC?","The @JsonView annotation in Spring MVC is used to activate a serialization view class, allowing the rendering of a subset of all fields in an Object."
"How can you activate multiple serialization views in a controller method?","To activate multiple serialization views in a controller method, you can use a composite interface. However, @JsonView allows an array of view classes, but you can specify only one per controller method."
"What is the purpose of the @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC is used to create or access an Object from the model and to bind it to the request through a WebDataBinder. It can be used on a method argument in @RequestMapping methods, as a method-level annotation in @Controller or @ControllerAdvice classes, or on a @RequestMapping method to mark its return value as a model attribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"How can a @ModelAttribute method be shared across controllers in Spring MVC?","A @ModelAttribute method can be shared across controllers in Spring MVC through @ControllerAdvice. This allows the method to be used in multiple controllers without the need to duplicate the code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"What is the default name chosen for a model attribute when using @ModelAttribute?","When using @ModelAttribute, the default name chosen for a model attribute is based on the Object type, as explained in the javadoc for Conventions. You can always assign an explicit name by using the overloaded addAttribute method or through the name attribute on @ModelAttribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot?","The @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot is used to initialize WebDataBinder instances. It can be used to bind request parameters to a model object, convert request values from string to object property types, and format model object properties as strings when rendering HTML forms. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"How can I register PropertyEditor, Converter, and Formatter components for type conversion in Spring Boot?","You can register PropertyEditor, Converter, and Formatter components in the DataBinder for type conversion by using the @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"What is the difference between constructor binding and property binding in Spring Boot?","Constructor binding uses only the request parameters it needs for constructor arguments, while property binding binds every request parameter for which there is a matching property. Constructor binding is preferred over property binding to prevent unexpected properties from being set. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"What are the two levels of validation in Spring MVC for @RequestMapping methods?","The two levels of validation in Spring MVC for @RequestMapping methods are @ModelAttribute, @RequestBody, and @RequestPart argument resolvers, and method validation.

"How do I handle exceptions in a Spring Boot controller using annotations?","You can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation in a @Controller or @ControllerAdvice class to handle exceptions from controller methods. The annotation can be used with a method that takes the exception as an argument and returns a response entity. The exception type can be specified as a method argument, and the method can be narrowed to match specific exception types. The behavior of root and cause exception matching can be surprising, so it's recommended to be as specific as possible in the argument signature. The distinction between root and cause exception matching can be controlled by the ExceptionDepthComparator and the order of the @ControllerAdvice beans. The passed-in exception is the actual FileSystemException or RemoteException instance only when they are thrown as top-level exceptions. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-exceptionhandler.html>)"
"What are the different types of arguments that can be used in an @ExceptionHandler method?","An @ExceptionHandler method can take the following arguments: Exception, HandlerMethod, WebRequest, NativeWebRequest, jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest, jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse, jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession, java.security.Principal, HttpMethod, java.util.Locale, java.util.TimeZone, java.time.ZoneId, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Writer, java.util.Map, org.springframework.ui.Model, org.springframework.ui.ModelMap, RedirectAttributes, @SessionAttribute, @RequestAttribute. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-exceptionhandler.html>)"

The return value can be used to convert the response through HttpMessageConverter instances, write to the response, render an RFC 9457 error response, add attributes to the model, or indicate no response body for REST controllers or default view name selection for HTML controllers. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-exceptionhandler.html>)"
"What is the purpose of @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice in Spring Boot?","The @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations are used to provide global exception handling and other advice for controller methods. They can be used to handle exceptions from any @Controller or other handler, and can be applied to any controller. The @RestControllerAdvice is meta-annotated with @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody, meaning that @ExceptionHandler methods will have their return value rendered via response body message conversion, rather than via HTML views. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.html)"
"How do you target specific controllers or packages with @ControllerAdvice?","You can target specific controllers or packages with @ControllerAdvice by using the annotations, assignableTypes, and basePackages attributes. For example, you can target all controllers annotated with @RestController, all controllers within specific packages, or all controllers assignable to specific classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.html)"
"How do local and global @ExceptionHandler methods interact in Spring Boot?","Local @ExceptionHandler methods, from the @Controller class, are applied before global @ExceptionHandler methods, from an @ControllerAdvice. Global @ExceptionHandler methods are applied after local ones, meaning that if both exist for the same exception, the global method will be executed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.html)"
"What is WebMvc.fn and what is its purpose?","WebMvc.fn is a lightweight functional programming model in Spring Web MVC that uses functions to route and handle requests. It is an alternative to the annotation-based programming model and runs on the same DispatcherServlet. Its purpose is to provide an immutable contract for handling HTTP requests with HandlerFunction and routing incoming requests to a handler function with RouterFunction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html)"
"What are the main components of WebMvc.fn?","The main components of WebMvc.fn are RouterFunction, HandlerFunction, ServerRequest, and ServerResponse. RouterFunction routes requests to a handler function, HandlerFunction handles the requests, ServerRequest is an immutable interface that provides access to the HTTP request, and ServerResponse is also an immutable interface that provides access to the HTTP response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html)"
"How can you filter handler functions in WebMvc.fn?","You can filter handler functions in WebMvc.fn by using the before, after, or filter methods on the routing function builder. These methods take a HandlerFilterFunction, which is a function that takes a ServerRequest and HandlerFunction and returns a ServerResponse. The handler function parameter represents the next element in the chain, which is typically the handler that is routed to, but it can also be another filter if multiple are applied. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html)"
"How can I build a URI using UriComponentsBuilder in Spring Framework?","You can use UriComponentsBuilder to build a URI by following these steps: 1. Create a UriComponentsBuilder instance using the static factory method fromUriString(). 2. Add or replace URI components using the queryParam() method. 3. Request to have the URI template and URI variables encoded using the encode() method. 4. Build a UriComponents instance using the build() method. 5. Expand variables and obtain the URI using the expand() and toUri() methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html)"
"What is the difference between UriComponentsBuilder#encode() and UriComponents#encode() in Spring Framework?","UriComponentsBuilder#encode() pre-encodes the URI template first and then strictly encodes URI variables when expanded, while UriComponents#encode() encodes URI components after URI variables are expanded. The former replaces characters with reserved meaning that appear in URI variables, while the latter does not replace characters with reserved meaning. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html)"
"How can I create a link to a controller method in Spring MVC?","You can use MvcUriComponentsBuilder to create a link to a controller method by referring to the method by name or using a technique akin to mock testing through proxies to avoid referring to the controller method by name. You can provide actual method argument values to be used as path variables and insert them into the URL. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html)"
"How can a controller method return a single asynchronous return value in Spring MVC?","A controller method can return a DeferredResult or a Callable to provide basic support for a single asynchronous return value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.html)"
"How can a controller method produce multiple asynchronous values and have them written to the response in Spring MVC?","A controller method can return a ResponseBodyEmitter, SseEmitter, or StreamingResponseBody to produce multiple asynchronous values and have them written to the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.html)"
"How does Spring MVC handle reactive types in controller methods?","Spring MVC supports use of reactive client libraries in a controller and adapts reactive types to similar behaviors as DeferredResult, ResponseBodyEmitter, or SseEmitter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.html)"
"What is CORS and why is it important for security?","CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that allows a web application running at one origin to make requests to a resource at a different origin. For security reasons, browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources outside the current origin. CORS is important for security because it prevents scripts from malicious websites from making AJAX requests to sensitive resources on a user's behalf, such as a bank account, without the user's knowledge or consent."
"How does Spring MVC handle CORS?","Spring MVC provides built-in support for handling CORS. After successfully mapping a request to a handler, HandlerMapping implementations check the CORS configuration for the given request and handler and take further actions. Preflight requests are handled directly, while simple and actual CORS requests are intercepted, validated, and have required CORS response headers set. Each HandlerMapping can be configured individually with URL pattern-based CorsConfiguration mappings, and applications can use the MVC Java configuration or the XML namespace to declare such mappings, which results in a single global map being passed to all HandlerMapping instances."
"What is the @CrossOrigin annotation in Spring MVC, and how is it used?","The @CrossOrigin annotation enables cross-origin requests on annotated controller methods. By default, it allows all origins, all headers, and all HTTP methods to which the controller method is mapped. The annotation can be used at the class level and is inherited by all methods. It can also be used at both the class level and the method level. The annotation can be customized to allow specific origins, headers, methods, and expose headers. The allowCredentials attribute is not enabled by default and should only be used where appropriate, as it establishes a trust level that exposes sensitive user-specific information."
"What is the Spring Framework's support for including details in the body of error responses for REST services?","The Spring Framework supports the 'Problem Details for HTTP APIs' specification, RFC 9457. The main abstractions for this support are ProblemDetail, ErrorResponse, and ErrorResponseException. ProblemDetail is a representation for an RFC 9457 problem detail, while ErrorResponse is a contract to expose HTTP error response details including HTTP status, response headers, and a body in the format of RFC 9457. ErrorResponseException is a basic ErrorResponse implementation that others can use as a convenient base class. All Spring MVC exceptions implement this. ResponseEntityExceptionHandler is a convenient base class for an @ControllerAdvice that handles all Spring MVC exceptions, and any ErrorResponseException, and renders an error response with a body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can you render an RFC 9457 response in Spring MVC?","You can return ProblemDetail or ErrorResponse from any @ExceptionHandler or from any @RequestMapping method to render an RFC 9457 response. The status property of ProblemDetail determines the HTTP status. The instance property of ProblemDetail is set from the current URL path, if not already set. For content negotiation, the Jackson HttpMessageConverter prefers 'application/problem+json' over 'application/json' when rendering a ProblemDetail, and also falls back on it if no compatible media type is found. To enable RFC 9457 responses for Spring WebFlux exceptions and for any ErrorResponseException, extend ResponseEntityExceptionHandler and declare it as an @ControllerAdvice in Spring configuration. The handler has an @ExceptionHandler method that handles any ErrorResponse exception, which includes all built-in web exceptions. You can add more exception handling methods, and use a protected method to map any exception to a ProblemDetail. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can you extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields in Spring MVC?","You can extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields in one of two ways. One, insert into the 'properties' Map of ProblemDetail. When using the Jackson library, the Spring Framework registers ProblemDetailJacksonMixin that ensures this 'properties' Map is unwrapped and rendered as top level JSON properties in the response, and likewise any unknown property during deserialization is inserted into this Map. You can also extend ProblemDetail to add dedicated non-standard properties. The copy constructor in ProblemDetail allows a subclass to make it easy to be created from an existing ProblemDetail. This could be done centrally, e.g. from an @ControllerAdvice such as ResponseEntityExceptionHandler that re-creates the ProblemDetail of an exception into a subclass with the additional non-standard fields. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html)"

"What is the WebSocket protocol and how does it work?","The WebSocket protocol is a standardized way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server over a single TCP connection. It begins with an HTTP request that uses the HTTP Upgrade header to switch to the WebSocket protocol. A successful handshake results in the TCP socket remaining open for both client and server to send and receive messages. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket.html)"
"How does the WebSocket protocol differ from HTTP in terms of architecture and application programming models?","WebSocket has an asynchronous, event-driven, messaging architecture, while HTTP follows a request-response style with many URLs. In WebSocket, there is usually only one URL for the initial connect, and all application messages flow on that same TCP connection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket.html)"
"What factors should be considered when deciding whether to use WebSocket for a web application?","Low latency, high frequency, and high volume of messages make the best case for using WebSocket.

A SockJS Java client is available in the spring-websocket module since version 4.1. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/fallback.html)"
"What are the different transport types supported by SockJS?","SockJS supports three general categories of transports: WebSocket, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP Long Polling. The WebSocket transport requires only a single HTTP request to do the WebSocket handshake, while HTTP transports require more requests. Ajax/XHR streaming, for example, relies on one long-running request for server-to-client messages and additional HTTP POST requests for client-to-server messages. Long polling is similar, except that it ends the current request after each server-to-client send. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/fallback.html)"
"What is the main purpose of STOMP in the context of WebSocket?","STOMP is a protocol that allows client and server to negotiate a sub-protocol to define the kind of messages each can send, their format, and content.

"What is the purpose of STOMP?","The purpose of STOMP is to provide a simple, text-oriented messaging protocol that can be used over any reliable two-way streaming network protocol, such as TCP and WebSocket. It was originally created for scripting languages to connect to enterprise message brokers and is designed to address a minimal subset of commonly used messaging patterns. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/overview.html)"
"What is the structure of a STOMP frame?","The structure of a STOMP frame consists of a COMMAND, headers, and a Body, followed by a termination character (^@). Frames are modeled on HTTP and can be used to send or subscribe for messages, along with a destination header that describes what the message is about and who should receive it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/overview.html)"
"How does Spring's STOMP support work with a dedicated STOMP broker?","When Spring's STOMP support is configured to work with a dedicated STOMP broker, Spring maintains TCP connections to the broker, relays messages to it, and passes messages from it down to connected WebSocket clients. This allows Spring web applications to rely on unified HTTP-based security, common validation, and a familiar programming model for message handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/overview.html)"
"What are the benefits of using STOMP as a sub-protocol in Spring Framework?","Using STOMP as a sub-protocol in Spring Framework provides several benefits, including no need to invent a custom messaging protocol and message format, availability of STOMP clients including a Java client in the Spring Framework, optional use of message brokers to manage subscriptions and broadcast messages, organization of application logic in multiple @Controller instances, routing of messages based on the STOMP destination header, and securing messages using Spring Security.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/message-flow.html)"
"How can an application handle messages from clients in Spring Boot using WebSocket?","An application can use annotated @Controller classes to handle messages from clients. Such classes can declare @MessageMapping, @SubscribeMapping, and @ExceptionHandler methods."
"What is the purpose of @MessageMapping annotation in Spring Boot WebSocket?","The @MessageMapping annotation is used to annotate methods that route messages based on their destination. It is supported at the method level as well as at the type level. By default, the mapping values are Ant-style path patterns, including support for template variables."
"How can an application handle exceptions from @MessageMapping methods in Spring Boot WebSocket?","An application can use @MessageExceptionHandler methods to handle exceptions from @MessageMapping methods. These methods support flexible method signatures and support the same method argument types and return values as @MessageMapping methods."
"How can an application component send messages to the brokerChannel in Spring Boot WebSocket?","The easiest way is to inject a SimpMessagingTemplate and use it to send messages. This can be done by injecting it by type or qualifying it by its name (brokerMessagingTemplate). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-send.html)"
"What is the purpose of the SimpMessagingTemplate in Spring Boot WebSocket?","The SimpMessagingTemplate is used to send messages to the brokerChannel from any part of the application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-send.html)"
"How can a bean of the same type as SimpMessagingTemplate be injected if another bean of the same type exists?","It can be qualified by its name (brokerMessagingTemplate). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-send.html)"
"What is the Simple Message Broker in Spring Boot and what does it handle?","The Simple Message Broker in Spring Boot handles subscription requests from clients, stores them in memory, and broadcasts messages to connected clients that have matching destinations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-simple-broker.html)"
"What kind of destinations does the Simple Message Broker support?","The Simple Message Broker supports path-like destinations, including subscriptions to Ant-style destination patterns. Applications can also use dot-separated (rather than slash-separated) destinations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-simple-broker.html)"
"How can you configure a task scheduler for the Simple Message Broker to support STOMP heartbeats?","To configure a scheduler, you can declare your own TaskScheduler bean and set it through the MessageBrokerRegistry. Alternatively, you can use the one that is automatically declared in the built-in WebSocket configuration, however, you’ll need @Lazy to avoid a cycle between the built-in WebSocket configuration and your WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-simple-broker.html)"
"What is the main limitation of the simple broker in Spring Boot?","The simple broker in Spring Boot supports only a subset of STOMP commands, does not support acks, receipts, and some other features, relies on a simple message-sending loop, and is not suitable for clustering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay.html)"
"How can you upgrade your Spring Boot applications to use a full-featured message broker?","You can upgrade your Spring Boot applications to use a full-featured message broker by installing the broker, running it with STOMP support enabled, and then enabling the STOMP broker relay in the Spring configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay.html)"
"What is the role of the STOMP broker relay in Spring Boot?","The STOMP broker relay is a Spring MessageHandler that handles messages by forwarding them to an external message broker. It establishes TCP connections to the broker, forwards all messages to it, and then forwards all messages received from the broker to clients through their WebSocket sessions. Essentially, it acts as a relay that forwards messages in both directions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'system' TCP connection maintained by the STOMP broker relay?","The 'system' TCP connection is used for messages originating from the server-side application only, not for receiving messages. It is also used to send and receive heartbeats to and from the message broker. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.html)"
"How can you configure the STOMP credentials for the 'system' TCP connection in the XML namespace and Java configuration?","You can configure the STOMP credentials for the 'system' TCP connection using the systemLogin and systemPasscode properties in both the XML namespace and Java configuration. The default values for these properties are 'guest' and 'guest'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.html)"
"How does the STOMP broker relay handle WebSocket client authentication?","The STOMP broker relay relies on HTTP authentication to protect the WebSocket endpoint and establish the client identity. WebSocket clients should not set the login and passcode headers as they are ignored. Instead, they should rely on HTTP authentication. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.html)"
"In Spring Boot, how can you switch the separator for message mapping patterns from slash to dot?","You can switch the separator for message mapping patterns from slash to dot by using the AntPathMatcher in Java configuration or XML configuration. In Java configuration, you can set the pathMatcher to use a dot as the separator by adding 'registry.setPathMatcher(new AntPathMatcher("".""));' in the configureMessageBroker method. In XML configuration, you can define a bean for the AntPathMatcher with a constructor argument of '.' and set it as the pathMatcher for the message broker. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/destination-separator.html)"
"How can you use a dot as the separator in @MessageMapping methods after switching the separator in Spring Boot?","After switching the separator in Spring Boot, you can use a dot as the separator in @MessageMapping methods by adding the dot as the separator in the method's annotation. For example, @MessageMapping('red.blue.{green}') will use the dot as the separator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/destination-separator.html)"
"How does changing the separator in Spring Boot affect the broker and the way it matches destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions?","Changing the separator in Spring Boot affects the broker and the way it matches destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions. If you switch the separator, that change also applies to the broker and the way the broker matches destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/destination-separator.html)"
"How does Spring handle user authentication for WebSocket and SockJS sessions?","Spring automatically associates the authenticated user from the HTTP request with a WebSocket or SockJS session created for them and, subsequently, with all STOMP messages transported over that session through a user header. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/authentication.html)"
"What is the purpose of the STOMP protocol's login and passcode headers on the CONNECT frame?","The login and passcode headers on the CONNECT frame were originally designed for and are needed for STOMP over TCP. However, for STOMP over WebSocket, by default, Spring ignores authentication headers at the STOMP protocol level, and assumes that the user is already authenticated at the HTTP transport level. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/authentication.html)"
"How is the security context for an authenticated user maintained in a typical web application?","The security context for the authenticated user is saved in the HTTP session and is associated with subsequent requests in the same cookie-based session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/authentication.html)"
"What is Token Authentication in Spring Security OAuth and how can it be used for Web applications and STOMP over WebSocket interactions?","Token Authentication in Spring Security OAuth is a support for token-based security, including JSON Web Token (JWT). It can be used as the authentication mechanism in Web applications, including STOMP over WebSocket interactions to maintain identity through a cookie-based session. However, cookie-based sessions are not always the best fit, especially in applications that do not maintain a server-side session or in mobile applications where it is common to use headers for authentication."
"What limitations are there for browser-based clients when it comes to authentication at the HTTP protocol level?","Browser-based clients can only use standard authentication headers (such as basic HTTP authentication) or cookies and cannot provide custom headers. They also do not have a way to send HTTP headers with SockJS transport requests, but they can send query parameters that can be used to send a token. However, this has its own drawbacks, such as the token possibly being logged with the URL in server logs."
"How can applications avoid using cookies for authentication and instead authenticate with headers at the STOMP messaging protocol level?","Applications can avoid using cookies for authentication by authenticating with headers at the STOMP messaging protocol level. This requires using the STOMP client to pass authentication headers at connect time and processing the authentication headers with a ChannelInterceptor. The server-side configuration can register a custom authentication interceptor, and the custom interceptor needs only to authenticate and set the user header on the CONNECT Message. Spring notes and saves the authenticated user and associates it with subsequent STOMP messages on the same session."
"How does Spring Security provide authorization for WebSocket sub-protocol messages?","Spring Security uses a ChannelInterceptor to authorize messages based on the user header in them. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-authorization)"
"What does Spring Session provide in terms of WebSocket integration?","Spring Session ensures the user's HTTP session does not expire while the WebSocket session is still active. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/reference/web-socket.html)"
"Where can I find more information about WebSocket sub-protocol authorization in Spring Security?","You can find more information in the Spring Security Reference Guide under the 'WebSocket Integration' section, specifically 'WebSocket Authorization'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-authorization)"
"How does Spring's STOMP support handle messages targeting a specific user?","Spring's STOMP support recognizes destinations prefixed with /user/ for messages targeting a specific user. For example, a client might subscribe to the /user/queue/position-updates destination. UserDestinationMessageHandler handles this destination and transforms it into a destination unique to the user session (such as /queue/position-updates-user123 ). This provides the convenience of subscribing to a generically named destination while, at the same time, ensuring no collisions with other users who subscribe to the same destination so that each user can receive unique stock position updates. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/user-destination.html)"
"What is the importance of configuring broker and application destination prefixes when working with user destinations?","Configuring broker and application destination prefixes is crucial when working with user destinations. If not configured, the broker would handle ""/user"" prefixed messages that should only be handled by UserDestinationMessageHandler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/user-destination.html)"
"How can a message-handling method send messages to the user associated with the message being handled?","A message-handling method can send messages to the user associated with the message being handled through the @SendToUser annotation (also supported on the class-level to share a common destination). For example, @Controller public class PortfolioController { @MessageMapping(""/trade"") @SendToUser(""/queue/position-updates"") public TradeResult executeTrade(Trade trade, Principal principal) { // ... return tradeResult; } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/user-destination.html)"
"How can I ensure that messages from the broker are published to the clientOutboundChannel in the exact order they were published?","You can set the setPreservePublishOrder flag to true in the MessageBrokerRegistry configuration. This can be done as follows: @Configuration @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker public class MyConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer { @Override protected void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry registry) { // ... registry.setPreservePublishOrder(true); } } The XML configuration equivalent is: <beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:websocket=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket"" xsi:schemaLocation="" http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket https://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket/spring-websocket.xsd""> <websocket:message-broker preserve-publish-order=""true""> <!-- ... --> </websocket:message-broker> </beans> (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html>)"
"What is the performance impact of enabling ordered publishing for messages within the same client session?","Enabling ordered publishing for messages within the same client session incurs a small performance overhead. This is because messages are processed one at a time on the clientOutboundChannel to maintain the order of publication. Therefore, you should enable ordered publishing only if it is required. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html>)"
"How can I ensure that messages from the client are handled in the exact order they were received?","To ensure that messages from the client are handled in the exact order they were received, you can set the setPreserveReceiveOrder flag to true in the StompEndpointRegistry configuration. This can be done as follows: @Configuration @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker public class MyConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer { @Override public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) { registry.setPreserveReceiveOrder(true); } } (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html>)"
"What events are published in Spring's ApplicationContext for STOMP WebSocket communication?","Several ApplicationContext events are published and can be received by implementing Spring’s ApplicationListener interface: BrokerAvailabilityEvent, SessionConnectEvent, SessionConnectedEvent, SessionSubscribeEvent, SessionUnsubscribeEvent, and SessionDisconnectEvent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.html)"
"What does the BrokerAvailabilityEvent indicate and when is it published?","The BrokerAvailabilityEvent indicates when the broker becomes available or unavailable. It is published whenever the state changes from connected to disconnected and vice-versa. Components that use the SimpMessagingTemplate should subscribe to this event and avoid sending messages at times when the broker is not available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.html)"
"What information is contained in a SessionConnectEvent and how can it be used?","A SessionConnectEvent contains the message that represents the connect, including the session ID, user information (if any), and any custom headers the client sent. It is useful for tracking client sessions. Components subscribed to this event can wrap the contained message with SimpMessageHeaderAccessor or StompMessageHeaderAccessor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.html)"
"How can you create and configure a WebSocketStompClient in Spring?","To create and configure a WebSocketStompClient in Spring, you can follow the example provided: WebSocketClient webSocketClient = new StandardWebSocketClient(); WebSocketStompClient stompClient = new WebSocketStompClient(webSocketClient); stompClient.setMessageConverter(new StringMessageConverter()); stompClient.setTaskScheduler(taskScheduler); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/client.html)"
"What is the purpose of the SockJsClient in Spring's STOMP over WebSocket client?","The SockJsClient in Spring's STOMP over WebSocket client can be used as an alternative to StandardWebSocketClient. It can use WebSocket or HTTP-based transport as a fallback. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/client.html)"
"How can you establish a connection and provide a handler for the STOMP session in Spring?","To establish a connection and provide a handler for the STOMP session in Spring, you can use the following example: String url = 'ws://127.0.0.1:8080/endpoint'; StompSessionHandler sessionHandler = new MyStompSessionHandler(); stompClient.connect(url, sessionHandler); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/client.html)"
"What is the purpose of the WebSocket scope in Spring Boot?","The WebSocket scope in Spring Boot allows you to declare a Spring-managed bean that is associated with a WebSocket session. This scope is useful for managing resources that are specific to a single WebSocket session, such as user-specific data or session-specific configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/scope.html)"
"How can you access the attributes of a WebSocket session in a Spring Boot controller?","To access the attributes of a WebSocket session in a Spring Boot controller, you can use the SimpMessageHeaderAccessor class. This class provides methods for retrieving the session attributes as a map. You can then use this map to access the attributes associated with the current WebSocket session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/scope.html)"
"What is the difference between the 'target' and 'proxy' modes for WebSocket-scoped beans in Spring Boot?","The 'target' mode for WebSocket-scoped beans in Spring Boot refers to the actual instance of the bean that is stored in the WebSocket session attributes. The 'proxy' mode, on the other hand, creates a proxy object that delegates method calls to the actual bean instance. Using the 'proxy' mode allows you to inject WebSocket-scoped beans into other beans and have the proxy object automatically resolve the actual bean instance from the WebSocket session attributes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/scope.html)"
"What factors affect performance in a messaging application backed by thread pools?","The size and volume of messages, whether application methods perform work that requires blocking, and external factors (such as network speed and other issues) affect performance in a messaging application backed by thread pools. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/configuration-performance.html)"
"How is the thread pool size for the clientInboundChannel typically configured?","By default, the clientInboundChannel is configured at twice the number of available processors. If the handling of messages in annotated methods is mainly CPU-bound, the number of threads for the clientInboundChannel should remain close to the number of processors. If the work they do is more IO-bound and requires blocking or waiting on a database or other external system, the thread pool size probably needs to be increased. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/configuration-performance.html)"
"How can you configure how long a send is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered when sending messages to a client?","You can use the sendTimeLimit and sendBufferSizeLimit properties to configure how long a send is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered when sending messages to a client. The general idea is that, at any given time, only a single thread can be used to send to a client. All additional messages, meanwhile, get buffered, and you can use these properties to decide how long sending a message is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered in the meantime. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/configuration-performance.html)"
"What is the purpose of WebSocketMessageBrokerStats bean in Spring Boot?","The WebSocketMessageBrokerStats bean gathers all available information related to the monitoring of client WebSocket sessions and provides insight into the internal state of the application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/stats.html)"
"What are the different types of sessions tracked by WebSocketMessageBrokerStats?","WebSocketMessageBrokerStats tracks three types of sessions: WebSocket sessions, HTTP streaming sessions, and polling SockJS sessions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/stats.html)"
"How can you view WebSocketMessageBrokerStats information in real-time?","You can view WebSocketMessageBrokerStats information in real-time by exporting the bean to JMX through Spring's MBeanExporter and using a tool like JDK's jconsole. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/stats.html)"
"What are the two main approaches to testing applications when using Spring's STOMP-over-WebSocket support?","The two main approaches are writing server-side tests to verify the functionality of controllers and their annotated message-handling methods, and writing full end-to-end tests that involve running a client and a server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/testing.html)"
"Which approach is more focused and easier to write and maintain?","Server-side tests are more focused and easier to write and maintain. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/testing.html)"
"What is the simplest form of server-side tests for controllers under test?","The simplest form of server-side tests is to write controller unit tests. However, this is not useful enough, since much of what a controller does depends on its annotations. Ideally, controllers under test should be invoked as they are at runtime, much like the approach to testing controllers that handle HTTP requests by using the Spring MVC Test framework — that is, without running a Servlet container but relying on the Spring Framework to invoke the annotated controllers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/testing.html)"
"What is the Web on Reactive Stack and what does it cover in the Spring Framework documentation?","The Web on Reactive Stack is a part of the Spring Framework documentation that covers support for reactive-stack web applications built on a Reactive Streams API to run on non-blocking servers. It includes chapters on the Spring WebFlux framework, the reactive WebClient, support for testing, and reactive libraries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html)"
"What are some examples of non-blocking servers supported by the Web on Reactive Stack?","The Web on Reactive Stack supports running on non-blocking servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring WebFlux?","Spring WebFlux is a reactive-stack web framework added to the Spring Framework in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html)"
"How do the Spring WebFlux and Spring Web MVC modules co-exist in the Spring Framework?","Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules (spring-webmvc and spring-webflux) and co-exist side by side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional, and applications can use one or the other module or both. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html)"
"What is the main difference between Spring WebFlux and Spring Web MVC?","Spring WebFlux is purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers, while Spring WebFlux is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on such servers as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html)"
"Why was Spring WebFlux created?","Spring WebFlux was created to address the need for a non-blocking web stack that can handle concurrency with a small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware resources. It was also created to take advantage of functional programming and the addition of lambda expressions in Java 8. The motivation for Spring WebFlux was to provide a new common API to serve as a foundation across any non-blocking runtime and to enable Spring to offer functional web endpoints alongside annotated controllers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/new-framework.html)"
"What does the term 'reactive' mean in the context of Spring WebFlux?","The term 'reactive' refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change. In the context of Spring WebFlux, it means that instead of being blocked, the application is now in the mode of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available. It also refers to non-blocking back pressure, which is a mechanism that controls the rate of events so that a fast producer does not overwhelm its destination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/new-framework.html)"
"What is the role of Reactive Streams in Spring WebFlux?","Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability in Spring WebFlux. It is a small spec that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure. It is of interest to libraries and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API because it is too low-level. Reactive Streams supports non-blocking back pressure and is adopted in Java 9. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/new-framework.html)"
"What is the purpose of HttpHandler in Spring WebFlux?","HttpHandler is a simple contract with a single method to handle a request and a response. It is intentionally minimal, and its main and only purpose is to be a minimal abstraction over different HTTP server APIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpHandler and WebHandler API in Spring WebFlux?","HttpHandler is a basic contract for HTTP request handling with non-blocking I/O and Reactive Streams back pressure, along with adapters for different servlet containers. WebHandler API is a slightly higher level, general-purpose web API for request handling, on top of which concrete programming models such as annotated controllers and functional endpoints are built. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html)"
"How can I configure buffer sizes for decoders and HttpMessageReaders in Spring WebFlux?","To configure buffer sizes, you can check if a given Decoder or HttpMessageReader exposes a maxInMemorySize property and if so the Javadoc will have details about default values. On the server side, ServerCodecConfigurer provides a single place from where to set all codecs. On the client side, the limit for all codecs can be changed in WebClient.Builder. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html)"
"What is the primary role of the DispatcherHandler in Spring WebFlux?","The DispatcherHandler is the central WebHandler in Spring WebFlux that provides a shared algorithm for request processing, while actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/dispatcher-handler.html)"
"What is the front controller pattern, and how does it relate to Spring WebFlux?","The front controller pattern is a design pattern where a central controller handles all requests. In Spring WebFlux, the DispatcherHandler is designed around this pattern. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/dispatcher-handler.html)"

(Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller.html})"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Spring WebFlux?","The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map requests to controllers methods. It has various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"Can you explain the use of composed annotations in Spring WebFlux?","Composed annotations are annotations that are themselves meta-annotated with @RequestMapping and composed to redeclare a subset (or all) of the @RequestMapping attributes with a narrower, more specific purpose. For example, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping are examples of composed annotations. They are provided because, arguably, most controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method versus using @RequestMapping, which, by default, matches to all HTTP methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"How can you narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request in Spring WebFlux?","You can narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request by using the consumes attribute in the @PostMapping annotation. The consumes attribute also supports negation expressions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"What is the purpose of @RequestMapping in Spring Boot?","The @RequestMapping annotation in Spring Boot is used to map HTTP requests to controller methods.

"What are the different controller method return values supported in Spring WebFlux?","The supported controller method return values in Spring WebFlux include: @ResponseBody, HttpEntity<B>, ResponseEntity<B>, HttpHeaders, ErrorResponse, ProblemDetail, String, View, java.util.Map, org.springframework.ui.Model, @ModelAttribute, void, Flux<ServerSentEvent>, Observable<ServerSentEvent>, or other reactive type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux handle multiple values when returning a Flux?","When returning a Flux, elements are streamed as they come and are not buffered. This is the default behavior, as keeping a potentially large amount of elements in memory is not efficient. If the media type implies an infinite stream, values are written and flushed individually. Otherwise, values are written individually and the flushing happens separately. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"How can applications trade memory efficiency for better handling of errors when encoding elements to JSON in Spring WebFlux?","Applications can choose to buffer elements and encode them all at once by returning a Flux<List<B>>. Reactor provides a dedicated operator for that, Flux#collectList(). This allows for better handling of errors when encoding elements to JSON. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What types of arguments in annotated controller methods require type conversion?","String-based request input arguments such as @RequestParam, @RequestHeader, @PathVariable, @MatrixVariable, and @CookieValue require type conversion if they are declared as something other than String. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"How does Spring Boot handle type conversion for annotated controller method arguments?","Type conversion is automatically applied based on the configured converters. By default, simple types such as int, long, Date, and others are supported. Type conversion can be customized through a WebDataBinder or by registering Formatters with the FormattingConversionService. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"How does Spring Boot handle an empty String source value in type conversion?","An empty String source value is treated as missing if it becomes null as a result of type conversion. This can be the case for Long, UUID, and other target types. If you want to allow null to be injected, either use the required flag on the argument annotation or declare the argument as @Nullable. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"What is the use of the @RequestParam annotation in Spring Boot?","The @RequestParam annotation is used to bind query parameters to a method argument in a controller. It can be used with both Java and Kotlin. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can I make a method parameter optional using @RequestParam?","You can make a method parameter optional by setting the required flag of a @RequestParam to false or by declaring the argument with a java.util.Optional wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"Can I use @RequestParam to access form data and multiparts?","No, @RequestParam only binds to query parameters. To access form data, multiparts, and query parameters, you can use data binding to apply them to a command object. In WebFlux, each is accessed individually through ServerWebExchange. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can I bind a request header to a method argument in a Spring Boot controller?","You can use the @RequestHeader annotation. For example, to get the value of the Accept-Encoding header, you would use @RequestHeader(""Accept-Encoding"") String encoding. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.html)"
"Can I get the value of multiple headers in a single method argument?","Yes, if you use @RequestHeader on a Map<String, String>, MultiValueMap<String, String>, or HttpHeaders argument, the map will be populated with all header values. For example, @RequestHeader(""Accept"") String[] accepts will get an array of all Accept header values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.html)"
"Is there automatic type conversion for request header values?","Yes, type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not String. For example, if you have @RequestHeader(""Accept"") List<String> accepts, the Accept header value will be converted to a list of strings. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.html)"
"What annotation is used to bind the value of an HTTP cookie to a method argument in a Spring Boot controller?","@CookieValue (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.html)"
"How can you access the value of a cookie named 'JSESSIONID' in a Spring Boot controller method?","By using the @CookieValue annotation with the argument name 'JSESSIONID'. Example: @GetMapping(""/demo"") public void handle(@CookieValue(""JSESSIONID"") String cookie) { //... } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.html)"
"Is type conversion automatically applied when using the @CookieValue annotation in a Spring Boot controller?","Yes, type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not String. See Type Conversion(typeconversion.html). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring WebFlux?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring WebFlux is used to bind request parameters onto a model object. It can be used to bind to an instance of a specified class, which may be accessed from the model, HTTP session, or instantiated through a default or primary constructor. It is recommended to use an object tailored specifically for web binding or apply constructor binding only for security reasons. When using constructor binding, you can customize request parameter names through an @BindParam annotation. The @ModelAttribute argument can be declared with or without a reactive type wrapper, and data binding errors can be handled by adding a BindingResult argument or directly through a reactive type wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How can you apply validation after data binding in Spring WebFlux?","You can apply validation after data binding in Spring WebFlux by adding the jakarta.validation.Valid annotation or Spring's @Validated annotation. This allows for the automatic application of validation after data binding. The @Valid annotation can be used on a model attribute argument, and if method validation applies because other parameters have @Constraint annotations, then HandlerMethodValidationException would be raised instead. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux support reactive types in the model?","Spring WebFlux supports reactive types in the model, such as Mono<Account>. You can declare a @ModelAttribute argument with or without a reactive type wrapper, and it will be resolved accordingly to the actual value. If data binding results in errors, by default a WebExchangeBindException is raised, but you can also handle errors directly through the reactive type wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot?","The @SessionAttributes annotation is used to store model attributes in the WebSession between requests. It is a type-level annotation that declares session attributes used by a specific controller. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How does the @SessionAttributes annotation work in Spring Boot?","On the first request, when a model attribute with the name, pet, is added to the model, it is automatically promoted to and saved in the WebSession. It remains there until another controller method uses a SessionStatus method argument to clear the storage. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How can I use the @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot?","To use the @SessionAttributes annotation, you need to apply it to a controller class and list the names of model attributes or types of model attributes that should be transparently stored in the session for subsequent requests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"What annotation is used in Spring Boot to access pre-existing session attributes managed globally outside the controller?","@SessionAttribute (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattribute.html)"
"How can you access a User object from a session attribute in a Spring Boot controller method?","By using the @SessionAttribute annotation on a method parameter, as shown in the example: Java Kotlin @GetMapping(""/"") public String handle(@SessionAttribute User user) { // ... } 1 Using @SessionAttribute . @GetMapping(""/"") fun handle(@SessionAttribute user: User): String { // ... } 1 Using @SessionAttribute .

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.html)"
"How can I use the @RequestAttribute annotation in a Spring Boot controller method?","To use the @RequestAttribute annotation in a Spring Boot controller method, you can add the annotation to a method parameter, as shown in the example: Java - @GetMapping(""/"") public String handle(@RequestAttribute Client client) { ... }, Kotlin - @GetMapping(""/"") fun handle(@RequestAttribute client: Client): String { ... }. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.html)"
"Can I use the @RequestAttribute annotation with different data types in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can use the @RequestAttribute annotation with different data types in Spring Boot. The data type should match the type of the request attribute you are accessing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.html)"
"How can you handle a file upload form in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can handle a file upload form in a Spring WebFlux controller by using data binding to a command object (modelattrib-method-args.html). The best way to handle a file upload form is through data binding to a command object, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin class MyForm { private String name; private MultipartFile file; // ... } @Controller public class FileUploadController { @PostMapping(""/form"") public String handleFormUpload(MyForm form, BindingResult errors) { // ... } } class MyForm( val name: String, val file: MultipartFile) @Controller class FileUploadController { @PostMapping(""/form"") fun handleFormUpload(form: MyForm, errors: BindingResult): String { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html)"
"How can you access individual parts with @RequestPart in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can access individual parts with @RequestPart in a Spring WebFlux controller by using the @RequestPart annotation. The following example shows how to use @RequestPart to get the metadata and file: Java Kotlin @PostMapping(""/"") public String handle(@RequestPart(""meta-data"") Part metadata, @RequestPart(""file-data"") FilePart file) { // ... } 1 Using @RequestPart to get the metadata. 2 Using @RequestPart to get the file. @PostMapping(""/"") fun handle(@RequestPart(""meta-data"") Part metadata, @RequestPart(""file-data"") FilePart file): String { // ... } 1 Using @RequestPart to get the metadata. 2 Using @RequestPart to get the file. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html)"
"How can you access all multipart data as a MultiValueMap in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can access all multipart data as a MultiValueMap in a Spring WebFlux controller by using @RequestBody. The following example shows how to use @RequestBody to access all multipart data as a MultiValueMap: Java Kotlin @PostMapping(""/"") public String handle(@RequestBody Mono<MultiValueMap<String, Part>> parts) { // ... } 1 Using @RequestBody. @PostMapping(""/"") fun handle(@RequestBody parts: MultiValueMap<String, Part>): String { // ... } 1 Using @RequestBody. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestBody annotation in Spring WebFlux?","The @RequestBody annotation in Spring WebFlux is used to have the request body read and deserialized into an Object through an HttpMessageReader. It supports reactive types and fully non-blocking reading and (client-to-server) streaming. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"How can I configure or customize message readers in Spring WebFlux?","You can use the HTTP message codecs option of the WebFlux Config to configure or customize message readers in Spring WebFlux. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"Can I use the @RequestBody annotation in combination with bean validation in Spring WebFlux?","Yes, you can use the @RequestBody annotation in combination with jakarta.validation.Valid or Spring’s @Validated annotation in Spring WebFlux, which causes Standard Bean Validation to be applied. Validation errors cause a WebExchangeBindException, which results in a 400 (BAD_REQUEST) response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpEntity and @RequestBody in Spring Boot?","HttpEntity is more or less identical to using @RequestBody, but it is based on a container object that exposes request headers and the body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html)"
"How can I handle an HTTP POST request with an entity in Spring Boot?","You can handle an HTTP POST request with an entity in Spring Boot by using the @PostMapping annotation and a parameter of type HttpEntity. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'entity' parameter in the provided example?","The 'entity' parameter in the provided example represents an HttpEntity containing an Account object, which can be used to access the request headers and body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html)"
"What does the @ResponseBody annotation do in Spring Boot?","The @ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot allows the return value of a method to be serialized and sent as the response body through an HttpMessageWriter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"Can @ResponseBody be used at the class level?","@ResponseBody can be used at the class level, in which case it is inherited by all controller methods. This is the effect of @RestController, which is marked with both @Controller and @ResponseBody. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"Does @ResponseBody support reactive types?","@ResponseBody supports reactive types, meaning you can return Reactor or RxJava types and have the asynchronous values they produce rendered to the response. For more information, see Streaming and JSON rendering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"What is the purpose of ResponseEntity in Spring Boot?","ResponseEntity is used to return a response with a specific status code and headers in Spring Boot. It is similar to @ResponseBody but provides additional control over the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How can I set an ETag header in a ResponseEntity in Spring Boot?","To set an ETag header in a ResponseEntity in Spring Boot, you can use the eTag() method when creating the ResponseEntity. For example: ResponseEntity.ok().eTag(etag).body(body); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How can I return an asynchronous response with ResponseEntity in Spring Boot WebFlux?","In Spring Boot WebFlux, you can return an asynchronous response with ResponseEntity by using reactive types such as Mono and Flux. You can use ResponseEntity<Mono<T>> or ResponseEntity<Flux<T>> to provide the response status and headers immediately while the body is provided asynchronously at a later point. You can also use Mono<ResponseEntity<T>> to provide all three - response status, headers, and body - asynchronously at a later point. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux support Jackson's Serialization Views?","Spring WebFlux provides built-in support for Jackson's Serialization Views, which allows rendering only a subset of all fields in an Object. To use it with @ResponseBody or ResponseEntity controller methods, you can use Jackson’s @JsonView annotation to activate a serialization view class, as shown in the example above."
"What is the purpose of @JsonView annotation in the context of Spring WebFlux and Jackson?","@JsonView annotation in the context of Spring WebFlux and Jackson is used to activate a serialization view class, allowing you to render only a subset of all fields in an Object. It can be used with @ResponseBody or ResponseEntity controller methods."
"Can you use multiple views with the @JsonView annotation in Spring WebFlux?","Yes, you can use an array of view classes with the @JsonView annotation. However, you can specify only one view per controller method. If you need to activate multiple views, you can use a composite interface."
"What is the purpose of the @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring Boot?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring Boot can be used to create or access an Object from the model and to bind it to the request through a WebDataBinder. It can also be used to initialize the model prior to any @RequestMapping method invocation. This section discusses @ModelAttribute methods, which are invoked before @RequestMapping methods in the same controller and can be shared across controllers through @ControllerAdvice. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"How can you use a @ModelAttribute method to add one attribute only in Spring Boot?","To add one attribute only using a @ModelAttribute method in Spring Boot, you can declare a method with the @ModelAttribute annotation and return the attribute you want to add. The attribute will be added to the model with a default name based on the type, or you can assign an explicit name using the overloaded addAttribute method or through the name attribute on @ModelAttribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"How can you use a @ModelAttribute method to support reactive types in the model in Spring Boot?","To support reactive types in the model using a @ModelAttribute method in Spring Boot, you can declare a method with the @ModelAttribute annotation and return a reactive type (such as Mono<Account> or io.reactivex.Single<Account>). The reactive model attribute can be transparently resolved to its actual value at the time of @RequestMapping invocation, provided a @ModelAttribute argument is declared without a wrapper. In addition, any model attributes with a reactive type wrapper are resolved to their actual values just prior to view rendering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot?","The @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot is used to initialize WebDataBinder instances that can bind request parameters to a model object, convert request values from string to object property types, and format model object properties as strings when rendering HTML forms. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"How can you customize the conversion process for request parameters in Spring Boot?","You can customize the conversion process for request parameters in Spring Boot by registering PropertyEditor, Converter, and Formatter components in the DataBinder for type conversion. Alternatively, you can use the WebFlux config to register Converter and Formatter components in a globally shared FormattingConversionService. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"What is the difference between constructor binding and property binding in Spring Boot?","Constructor binding uses only the request parameters it needs for constructor arguments, and any other input is ignored. In contrast, property binding, by default, binds every request parameter for which there is a matching property. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux handle validation for @RequestMapping methods?","Spring WebFlux has built-in validation for @RequestMapping methods, including Java Bean Validation. Validation may be applied at one of two levels: @ModelAttribute, @RequestBody, and @RequestPart argument resolvers validate a method argument individually if the method parameter is annotated with Jakarta @Valid or Spring’s @Validated, AND there is no Errors or BindingResult parameter immediately after, AND method validation is not needed. The exception raised in this case is WebExchangeBindException. When @Constraint annotations such as @Min, @NotBlank and others are declared directly on method parameters, or on the method (for the return value), then method validation must be applied, and that supersedes validation at the method argument level because method validation covers both method parameter constraints and nested constraints via @Valid. The exception raised in this case is HandlerMethodValidationException. Applications must handle both WebExchangeBindException and HandlerMethodValidationException as either may be raised depending on the controller method signature. The two exceptions, however, are designed to be very similar, and can be handled with almost identical code. The main difference is that the former is for a single object while the latter is for a list of method parameters. @Valid is not a constraint annotation, but rather for nested constraints within an Object. Therefore, by itself @Valid does not lead to method validation. @NotNull on the other hand is a constraint, and adding it to an @Valid parameter leads to method validation. For nullability specifically, you may also use the required flag of @RequestBody or @ModelAttribute. Method validation may be used in combination with Errors or BindingResult method parameters. However, the controller method is called only if all validation errors are on method parameters with an Errors immediately after. If there are validation errors on any other method parameter then HandlerMethodValidationException is raised. You can configure a Validator globally through the WebFlux config, or locally through an @InitBinder method in an @Controller or @ControllerAdvice. You can also use multiple validators. If a controller has a class level @Validated, then method validation is applied through an AOP proxy. In order to take advantage of the Spring MVC built-in support for method validation added in Spring Framework 6.1, you need to remove the class level @Validated annotation from the controller. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-validation.html)"
"How can I handle validation errors in Spring WebFlux?","You can handle validation errors in Spring WebFlux by extending ResponseEntityExceptionHandler or using an @ExceptionHandler method in a controller or in a @ControllerAdvice, and handling HandlerMethodValidationException directly. The exception contains a list of ParameterValidationResult that group validation errors by method parameter. You can either iterate over those, or provide a visitor with callback methods by controller method parameter type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-validation.html)"
"How can I configure a Validator for Spring WebFlux?","You can configure a Validator for Spring WebFlux globally through the WebFlux config, or locally through an @InitBinder method in an @Controller or @ControllerAdvice. You can also use multiple validators. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-validation.html)"
"How can I handle exceptions in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can handle exceptions in a Spring WebFlux controller by declaring an @ExceptionHandler method in your @Controller or @ControllerAdvice class. The exception can match against a top-level exception being propagated or against the immediate cause within a top-level wrapper exception. Preferably, declare the target exception as a method argument. Alternatively, you can narrow the exception types to match in the annotation declaration. It is recommended to be as specific as possible in the argument signature and to declare your primary root exception mappings on a @ControllerAdvice prioritized with a corresponding order. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.html>)"
"What method arguments are supported in an @ExceptionHandler method in Spring WebFlux?","@ExceptionHandler methods in Spring WebFlux support the same method arguments as @RequestMapping methods, except the request body might have been consumed already.

"What return values are supported in an @ExceptionHandler method in Spring WebFlux?","@ExceptionHandler methods in Spring WebFlux support the same return values as @RequestMapping methods. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations in Spring Boot?","The @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations are used to declare methods that apply more globally across controllers, such as @ExceptionHandler, @InitBinder, and @ModelAttribute methods. The @ControllerAdvice annotation is annotated with @Component, which means that such classes can be registered as Spring beans through component scanning. The @RestControllerAdvice annotation is a composed annotation that is annotated with both @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody, which essentially means @ExceptionHandler methods are rendered to the response body through message conversion. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-advice.html)"
"How can you narrow down the scope of @ControllerAdvice methods to a subset of controllers?","You can use attributes on the @ControllerAdvice annotation to target specific controllers based on annotations, packages, or assignable types. For example, you can target all controllers annotated with @RestController, within specific packages, or assignable to specific classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-advice.html)"
"What is the difference between local and global @ExceptionHandler methods in Spring Boot?","Local @ExceptionHandler methods are declared within the @Controller class, while global @ExceptionHandler methods are declared in a class annotated with @ControllerAdvice. Global @ExceptionHandler methods are applied after local ones. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-advice.html)"
"What is the purpose of the UriComponentsBuilder class in Spring Framework?","The UriComponentsBuilder class in Spring Framework helps to build URIs from URI templates with variables. It provides various options to encode, expand, and build URIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/uri-building.html)"
"How can you configure RestTemplate and WebClient to customize the preparation of URIs in Spring Framework?","You can configure RestTemplate and WebClient with a UriBuilderFactory to customize the preparation of URIs. The DefaultUriBuilderFactory is a default implementation of UriBuilderFactory that uses UriComponentsBuilder internally and exposes shared configuration options. You can configure RestTemplate and WebClient with a UriBuilderFactory to customize the preparation of URIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/uri-building.html)"
"What are the different encoding modes available in DefaultUriBuilderFactory and how do they differ?","The DefaultUriBuilderFactory provides four encoding modes: TEMPLATE_AND_VALUES, VALUES_ONLY, URI_COMPONENT, and NONE. TEMPLATE_AND_VALUES encodes the URI template and strictly encodes URI variables when expanded, while VALUES_ONLY does not encode the URI template and strictly encodes URI variables. URI_COMPONENT encodes URI component value after URI variables are expanded, and NONE applies no encoding. The encoding mode can be set in DefaultUriBuilderFactory and used by RestTemplate and WebClient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/uri-building.html)"
"What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web development?","Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that lets you specify what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized, rather than using less secure and less powerful workarounds based on IFRAME or JSONP. It is used to enable a web application running at one origin to access selected resources from a different origin."
"How does Spring WebFlux handle CORS requests?","Spring WebFlux HandlerMapping implementations provide built-in support for CORS. After successfully mapping a request to a handler, a HandlerMapping checks the CORS configuration for the given request and handler and takes further actions. Preflight requests are handled directly, while simple and actual CORS requests are intercepted, validated, and have the required CORS response headers set."
"How can you enable CORS in the WebFlux Java configuration?","To enable CORS in the WebFlux Java configuration, you can use the CorsRegistry callback, as shown in the example. By default global configuration enables all origins, all headers, GET, HEAD, and POST methods, and allows credentials. You can customize these settings by adding mappings to the CorsRegistry."
"What is the main abstraction for the Spring Framework's support of the 'Problem Details for HTTP APIs' specification?","ProblemDetail — representation for an RFC 9457 problem detail; a simple container for both standard fields defined in the spec, and for non-standard ones. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can you extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields?","You can extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields in one of two ways. One, insert into the ""properties"" Map of ProblemDetail. When using the Jackson library, the Spring Framework registers ProblemDetailJacksonMixin that ensures this ""properties"" Map is unwrapped and rendered as top level JSON properties in the response, and likewise any unknown property during deserialization is inserted into this Map. You can also extend ProblemDetail to add dedicated non-standard properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can a client application catch and handle error responses using the WebClient and RestTemplate in Spring WebFlux?","A client application can catch WebClientResponseException, when using the WebClient, or RestClientResponseException when using the RestTemplate, and use their getResponseBodyAs methods to decode the error response body to any target type such as ProblemDetail, or a subclass of ProblemDetail.

"What is the primary purpose of HTTP caching in a web application?","HTTP caching can significantly improve the performance of a web application. It revolves around the Cache-Control response header and subsequent conditional request headers, such as Last-Modified and ETag. Cache-Control advises private (for example, browser) and public (for example, proxy) caches how to cache and re-use responses. An ETag header is used to make a conditional request that may result in a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) without a body, if the content has not changed. ETag can be seen as a more sophisticated successor to the Last-Modified header. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/caching.html)"
"What is the purpose of the CacheControl class in Spring WebFlux?","CacheControl provides support for configuring settings related to the Cache-Control header and is accepted as an argument in a number of places: Controllers, Static Resources. While RFC 7234 describes all possible directives for the Cache-Control response header, the CacheControl type takes a use case-oriented approach that focuses on the common scenarios. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/caching.html)"
"How can a controller add explicit support for HTTP caching in Spring WebFlux?","A controller can add an ETag and Cache-Control settings to a ResponseEntity, as the following example shows: 

```java
@GetMapping(""/book/{id}"")
public ResponseEntity<Book> showBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Book book = findBook(id);
    String version = book.getVersion();
    return ResponseEntity .ok() .cacheControl(CacheControl.maxAge(30, TimeUnit.DAYS)) .eTag(version) // lastModified is also available .body(book);
}
```
The preceding example sends a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) response with an empty body if the comparison to the conditional request headers indicates the content has not changed. Otherwise, the ETag and Cache-Control headers are added to the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/caching.html)"
"What are the view technologies integrated with Spring WebFlux?","Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and others. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-view.html)"
"What is Thymeleaf and why is it useful?","Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine that emphasizes natural HTML templates that can be previewed in a browser by double-clicking, which is very helpful for independent work on UI templates (for example, by a designer) without the need for a running server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-view.html)"
"How do I configure FreeMarker as a view technology in Spring WebFlux?","You can configure FreeMarker as a view technology by declaring a few beans, such as SpringResourceTemplateResolver, SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine, and ThymeleafReactiveViewResolver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-view.html)"
"How do you enable WebFlux in Java configuration?","You can use the @EnableWebFlux annotation in your Java config, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin @Configuration @EnableWebFlux public class WebConfig { } @Configuration @EnableWebFlux class WebConfig (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/config.html#_enabling_webflux_config)"
"How do you customize the global Validator instance in Java configuration?","In your Java configuration, you can customize the global Validator instance, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin @Configuration @EnableWebFlux public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer { @Override public Validator getValidator() { // ... } } @Configuration @EnableWebFlux class WebConfig : WebFluxConfigurer { override fun getValidator(): Validator { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/config.html#_validation)"
"How do you configure content type resolution in WebFlux Java configuration?","You can configure how Spring WebFlux determines the requested media types for @Controller instances from the request. By default, only the Accept header is checked, but you can also enable a query parameter-based strategy. The following example shows how to customize the requested content type resolution: Java Kotlin @Configuration @EnableWebFlux public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer { @Override public void configureContentTypeResolver(RequestedContentTypeResolverBuilder builder) { // ... } } @Configuration @EnableWebFlux class WebConfig : WebFluxConfigurer { override fun configureContentTypeResolver(builder: RequestedContentTypeResolverBuilder) { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/config.html#_content_type_resolvers)"
"Which web servers support HTTP/2 in Spring Boot?","Reactor Netty, Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow support HTTP/2 in Spring Boot. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/http2.html)"
"Is there any specific configuration required for HTTP/2 support in Spring Boot?","Yes, there are considerations related to server configuration for HTTP/2 support in Spring Boot. For more details, refer to the HTTP/2 wiki page. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/http2.html)"
"Where can I find more information about HTTP/2 support in Spring Boot?","You can find more information about HTTP/2 support in Spring Boot on the HTTP/2 wiki page. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/http2.html)"
"What is WebClient in Spring WebFlux and what are its key features?","WebClient in Spring WebFlux is a client for performing HTTP requests with a functional, fluent API based on Reactor. Its key features include being fully non-blocking, supporting streaming, and relying on the same codecs used on the server side. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)"
"Which HTTP client libraries does WebClient support out of the box?","WebClient supports Reactor Netty, JDK HttpClient, Jetty Reactive HttpClient, and Apache HttpComponents out of the box. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)"
"How can you customize the HTTP client library used by WebClient?","You can customize the HTTP client library used by WebClient by plugging in other libraries via the ClientHttpConnector. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)"
"How can the retrieve() method be used in Spring WebClient to declare how to extract the response?","The retrieve() method in Spring WebClient can be used to declare how to extract the response. This can be done by using methods like toEntity(), bodyToMono(), or bodyToFlux(), depending on whether you want to get the entire response entity, the body only, or a stream of decoded objects, respectively. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-retrieve.html)"
"How can you customize the handling of error responses in Spring WebClient using the retrieve() method?","To customize the handling of error responses in Spring WebClient, you can use the onStatus handlers within the retrieve() method. This allows you to specify custom behavior for specific HTTP status codes, such as 4xx client errors and 5xx server errors. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-retrieve.html)"
"What are the different ways to extract the body of a response using the retrieve() method in Spring WebClient?","There are several ways to extract the body of a response using the retrieve() method in Spring WebClient. You can use bodyToMono() to get a Mono containing the decoded body, or bodyToFlux() to get a Flux of decoded objects if the response is a stream of events. Additionally, you can use awaitBody() in Kotlin to get the body as a single value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-retrieve.html)"
"What are the `exchangeToMono()` and `exchangeToFlux()` methods used for in Spring WebFlux?","These methods are used for more advanced cases that require more control, such as to decode the response differently depending on the response status. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-exchange.html)"
"How can I decode the response differently depending on the response status using `exchangeToMono()` or `exchangeToFlux()`?","You can use a function that takes a `ServerResponse` as input and returns a `Mono` or `Flux` of the desired type. Inside this function, you can check the status code of the response and decode the body accordingly. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-exchange.html)"
"What happens to the response body after the returned Mono or Flux completes when using `exchangeToMono()` or `exchangeToFlux()`?","The response body is checked and if not consumed, it is released to prevent memory and connection leaks. Therefore, the response cannot be decoded further downstream. It is up to the provided function to declare how to decode the response if needed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-exchange.html)"
"How can I register a client filter (ExchangeFilterFunction) in Spring WebClient?","You can register a client filter (ExchangeFilterFunction) through the WebClient.Builder in order to intercept and modify requests. This can be done using the filter method in the WebClient.Builder class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-filter.html)"
"What is the purpose of client filters in Spring WebClient?","Client filters in Spring WebClient are used for cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication. They can be used to intercept and modify requests and responses. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-filter.html)"
"How can I add or remove filters from an existing WebClient instance?","Filters can be added or removed by mutating an existing WebClient instance using the mutate() method. This will result in a new WebClient instance that does not affect the original one. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-filter.html)"
"How can you pass information through the filter chain in Spring WebFlux?","You can pass information through the filter chain by adding attributes to a request. This is convenient if you want to influence the behavior of filters for a given request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"What is the purpose of adding attributes to a request in Spring WebFlux?","The purpose of adding attributes to a request in Spring WebFlux is to pass information through the filter chain and influence the behavior of filters for a given request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"How can you configure a defaultRequest callback globally at the WebClient.Builder level in Spring WebFlux?","You can configure a defaultRequest callback globally at the WebClient.Builder level by using the filter method. This allows you to insert attributes into all requests, which could be used for example in a Spring MVC application to populate request attributes based on ThreadLocal data. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"How can I pass information to the filter chain in Spring WebClient?","You can use client-attributes to pass information to the filter chain in Spring WebClient. This information only influences the current request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"What is the difference between using client-attributes and Reactor Context in Spring WebClient?","Client-attributes provide a convenient way to pass information to the filter chain but only influence the current request. Reactor Context, on the other hand, allows you to pass information that propagates to additional requests, such as nested requests or requests executed after concatMap. Reactor Context needs to be populated at the end of a reactive chain to apply to all operations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-context.html)"
"How do I populate the Reactor Context in Spring WebClient to apply to all operations?","To populate the Reactor Context in Spring WebClient and apply it to all operations, you need to use the contextWrite method. For example: client.get().uri('https://example.org/').retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class).flatMap(body -> { // perform nested request (context propagates automatically)... }).contextWrite(context -> context.put('foo', ...)); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-context.html)"
"How can WebClient be used in synchronous style in Spring WebFlux?","WebClient can be used in synchronous style by blocking at the end for the result. The following example demonstrates how to do this in Java and Kotlin: Java: Person person = client.get().uri('/person/{id}', i).retrieve() .bodyToMono(Person.class).block(); List<Person> persons = client.get().uri('/persons').retrieve() .bodyToFlux(Person.class).collectList().block(); Kotlin: val person = runBlocking { client.get().uri('/person/{id}', i).retrieve() .awaitBody<Person>() } val persons = runBlocking { client.get().uri('/persons').retrieve() .bodyToFlow<Person>().toList() } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-synchronous.html)"
"What is the advantage of avoiding blocking on each response individually in Spring WebFlux?","Avoiding blocking on each response individually in Spring WebFlux is more efficient, especially when multiple calls need to be made. By waiting for the combined result, you can avoid potential performance issues caused by blocking. The following example demonstrates how to do this in Java and Kotlin: Java: Mono<Person> personMono = client.get().uri('/person/{id}', personId).retrieve().bodyToMono(Person.class); Mono<List<Hobby>> hobbiesMono = client.get().uri('/person/{id}/hobbies', personId).retrieve().bodyToFlux(Hobby.class).collectList(); Map<String, Object> data = Mono.zip(personMono, hobbiesMono, (person, hobbies) -> { Map<String, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>(); map.put('person', person); map.put('hobbies', hobbies); return map; }).block(); Kotlin: val data = runBlocking { val personDeferred = async { client.get().uri('/person/{id}', personId).retrieve().awaitBody<Person>() } val hobbiesDeferred = async { client.get().uri('/person/{id}/hobbies', personId).retrieve().bodyToFlow<Hobby>().toList() } mapOf('person' to personDeferred.await(), 'hobbies' to hobbiesDeferred.await()) } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-synchronous.html)"
"What should you never have to do in a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux controller when using Flux or Mono?","You should never have to block in a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux controller when using Flux or Mono. Instead, you should simply return the resulting reactive type from the controller method. The same principle applies to Kotlin Coroutines and Spring WebFlux, just use suspending functions or return Flow in your controller method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-synchronous.html)"
"How can I test code that uses the WebClient in Spring Boot?","You can use a mock web server, such as the OkHttp MockWebServer (https://github.com/square/okhttp#mockwebserver). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-testing.html)"
"Where can I find an example of using the OkHttp MockWebServer with WebClient in Spring Boot?","You can check out the WebClientIntegrationTests in the Spring Framework test suite (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-webflux/src/test/java/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClientIntegrationTests.java) or the static-server sample in the OkHttp repository (https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/samples/static-server). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-testing.html)"
"What is an alternative to using a mock web server for testing WebClient in Spring Boot?","There is no direct alternative mentioned in the provided information. However, you can consider using a real web server or a testing framework that supports reactive programming. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-testing.html)"
"What is the advantage of defining an HTTP service as a Java interface with HTTP exchange methods in the Spring Framework?","It simplifies HTTP remote access and provides additional flexibility for choosing an API style such as synchronous or reactive. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-http-interface-client.html)"
"How does the Spring Framework help in generating a proxy that implements an HTTP service interface and performs exchanges?","It allows you to define an HTTP service as a Java interface with HTTP exchange methods, and then generates a proxy that implements this interface and performs the exchanges. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-http-interface-client.html)"
"Where can I find more information about REST endpoints and the HTTP interface client in the Spring Framework documentation?","You can find more information in the Spring Framework documentation under REST Endpoints at https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-http-interface-client.html. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-http-interface-client.html)"
"What is the WebSocket protocol and how does it differ from HTTP?","The WebSocket protocol is a standardized way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server over a single TCP connection. It is designed to work over HTTP, using ports 80 and 443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules. A WebSocket interaction begins with an HTTP request that uses the HTTP Upgrade header to upgrade or, in this case, to switch to the WebSocket protocol. Unlike HTTP, WebSocket is a low-level transport protocol that does not prescribe any semantics to the content of messages. This means that there is no way to route or process a message unless the client and the server agree on message semantics. WebSocket clients and servers can negotiate the use of a higher-level, messaging protocol (for example, STOMP), through the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header on the HTTP handshake request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-websocket.html)"
"How can you create a WebSocket server using the Spring Framework?","To create a WebSocket server using the Spring Framework, you can first create a WebSocketHandler. The following example shows how to do so:<br><br>Java<br><br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketHandler;<br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketSession;<br><br>public class MyWebSocketHandler implements WebSocketHandler {<br>  @Override<br>  public Mono<Void> handle(WebSocketSession session) {<br>    // ...<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Kotlin<br><br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketHandler<br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketSession<br><br>class MyWebSocketHandler : WebSocketHandler {<br>  override fun handle(session: WebSocketSession): Mono<Void> {<br>    // ...<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Then you can map it to a URL:<br><br>Java<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  @Bean<br>  public HandlerMapping handlerMapping() {<br>    Map<String, WebSocketHandler> map = new HashMap<>();<br>    map.put(&quot;/path&quot;, new MyWebSocketHandler());<br>    int order = -1; // before annotated controllers<br>    return new SimpleUrlHandlerMapping(map, order);<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Kotlin<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  @Bean<br>  fun handlerMapping(): HandlerMapping {<br>    val map = mapOf(&quot;/path&quot; to MyWebSocketHandler())<br>    val order = -1 // before annotated controllers<br>    return SimpleUrlHandlerMapping(map, order)<br>  }<br>}<br><br>If using the WebFlux Config, there is nothing further to do, or otherwise if not using the WebFlux config, you’ll need to declare a WebSocketHandlerAdapter as shown below:<br><br>Java<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  // ...<br>  @Bean<br>  public WebSocketHandlerAdapter handlerAdapter() {<br>    return new WebSocketHandlerAdapter();<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Kotlin<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  // ...<br>  @Bean<br>  fun handlerAdapter() = WebSocketHandlerAdapter()<br>}<br><br>WebSocketHandler: The handle method of WebSocketHandler takes WebSocketSession and returns Mono<Void> to indicate when application handling of the session is complete. The session is handled through two streams, one for inbound and one for outbound messages. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-websocket.html)"
"What is the difference between the WebSocket protocol and other TCP protocols like HTTP?","The WebSocket protocol is designed to work over HTTP, using ports 80 and 443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules.

"What is the primary purpose of the RSocket protocol?","The RSocket protocol is designed for multiplexed, duplex communication over TCP, WebSocket, and other byte stream transports, using one of the following interaction models: Request-Response, Request-Stream, Channel, and Fire-and-Forget. Its main feature is that it allows for reactive streams semantics across the network boundary and supports back pressure signaling between requester and responder. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html)"
"How does RSocket handle connection resumption and back pressure?","RSocket supports session resumption, which is designed for loss of connectivity and requires some state to be maintained. The state management is transparent for applications, and works well in combination with back pressure which can stop a producer when possible and reduce the amount of state required. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html)"
"What is the role of RSocketStrategies in RSocketRequester configuration?","RSocketStrategies is used to configure an RSocketRequester. It allows you to provide encoders and decoders for (de)-serialization of data and metadata values, and is designed for re-use. In some scenarios, it may be preferable to declare it in Spring configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html)"
"What is the main purpose of reactor-core in Spring WebFlux?","Reactor-core is used internally by Spring WebFlux to compose asynchronous logic and provide Reactive Streams support. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-reactive-libraries.html)"
"How does WebFlux handle different Reactive Streams Publisher implementations?","WebFlux treats a provided Publisher as a stream with unknown semantics (0..N). To express cardinality, it's recommended to wrap the Publisher with Flux or Mono.from(Publisher) instead of passing the raw Publisher. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-reactive-libraries.html)"
"How does the ReactiveAdapterRegistry in Spring WebFlux support pluggable reactive libraries?","The ReactiveAdapterRegistry provides pluggable support for reactive libraries like RxJava 3, Kotlin coroutines, and SmallRye Mutiny. You can also register other libraries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-reactive-libraries.html)"
"What is the section of the Spring Framework reference documentation that covers integration with a variety of technologies?","The section is called 'Integration' (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration.html)"
"What is the name of the section that discusses Spring Framework's integration with Java Message Service (JMS)?","The section is called 'JMS' (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration.html)"
"Which section of the reference documentation covers Spring Framework's support for caching using a cache abstraction?","The section is called 'Cache Abstraction' (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration.html)"
"How can I create a custom RestClient in Spring Boot?","To create a custom RestClient in Spring Boot, you can use the builder() method to get a builder with further options such as specifying which HTTP library to use and which message converters to use. You can then use the builder to set the desired options and create the RestClient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-restclient)"
"How can I convert JSON to objects using RestClient in Spring Boot?","To convert JSON to objects using RestClient in Spring Boot, you can use the body(Class) method to convert the response contents into various types, such as bytes to a String, JSON to objects using Jackson, and so on. You can also use the accept(MediaType…) method to set the Accept header to application/json. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-restclient)"
"How can I handle errors when using RestClient in Spring Boot?","To handle errors when using RestClient in Spring Boot, you can use the onStatus(HttpStatusCode::is4xxClientError, (request, response) -> { throw new MyCustomRuntimeException(response.getStatusCode(), response.getHeaders()); }) method to set up a status handler for all 4xx status codes and throw a custom exception. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-restclient)"
"What is the purpose of the JmsTemplate class in Spring's JMS integration framework?","The JmsTemplate class is used for message production and synchronous message reception. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms.html)"
"What is the purpose of the MessageConverter abstraction in Spring's JMS support?","The MessageConverter abstraction is used to convert between Java objects and JMS messages. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JmsTransactionManager class in Spring's JMS support?","The JmsTransactionManager class is an implementation of Spring's PlatformTransactionManager for JMS, allowing for seamless integration of JMS as a transactional resource into Spring's transaction management mechanisms. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JmsTemplate class in Spring's JMS components?","The JmsTemplate class is the central class in the JMS core package. It simplifies the use of JMS, since it handles the creation and release of resources when sending or synchronously receiving messages. Code that uses the JmsTemplate needs only to implement callback interfaces that give them a clearly defined high-level contract. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/using.html)"
"What is the default acknowledgment mode for messages in JmsTemplate, and what are the potential issues with using this mode?","The default acknowledgment mode for messages in JmsTemplate is AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE. This mode does not provide proper reliability guarantees. Messages can get lost when listener execution fails (since the provider automatically acknowledges each message after listener invocation, with no exceptions to be propagated to the provider) or when the listener container shuts down (you can configure this by setting the acceptMessagesWhileStopping flag). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/using.html)"
"What are the differences between SimpleMessageListenerContainer and DefaultMessageListenerContainer in Spring's JMS components?","SimpleMessageListenerContainer is the simpler of the two standard flavors. It creates a fixed number of JMS sessions and consumers at startup, registers the listener by using the standard JMS MessageConsumer.setMessageListener() method, and leaves it up the JMS provider to perform listener callbacks. This variant does not allow for dynamic adaption to runtime demands or for participation in externally managed transactions. DefaultMessageListenerContainer allows for dynamic adaptation to runtime demands and is able to participate in externally managed transactions. Each received message is registered with an XA transaction when configured with a JtaTransactionManager. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/using.html)"
"How can you send a message using the JmsTemplate in Spring Boot?","The JmsTemplate contains many convenience methods to send a message. Send methods specify the destination by using a jakarta.jms.Destination object, and others specify the destination by using a String in a JNDI lookup. The send method that takes no destination argument uses the default destination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/sending.html)"
"How can you use MessageConverters in the JmsTemplate to send domain model objects?","The JmsTemplate has various send methods that take a Java object as an argument for a message's data content. The overloaded methods convertAndSend() and receiveAndConvert() methods in JmsTemplate delegate the conversion process to an instance of the MessageConverter interface. The default implementation (SimpleMessageConverter) supports conversion between String and TextMessage, byte[] and BytesMessage, and java.util.Map and MapMessage. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/sending.html)"
"How can you modify a message header and property after a java.util.Map is converted to a message using the JmsTemplate?","You can use the MessagePostProcessor interface to modify a message header and property after a java.util.Map is converted to a message. The following example shows how to modify a message header and a property after a java.util.Map is converted to a message. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/sending.html)"
"What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous reception in JMS with Spring?","Synchronous reception in JMS with Spring involves the calling thread blocking until a message becomes available, which can potentially be blocked indefinitely. Asynchronous reception, on the other hand, uses Message-Driven POJOs (MDPs) that act as receivers for JMS messages and can be implemented through the @JmsListener annotation. This is the most convenient way to setup an asynchronous receiver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/receiving.html)"
"What is the SessionAwareMessageListener interface and how is it used in Spring's asynchronous messaging support?","The SessionAwareMessageListener interface is a Spring-specific interface that provides a similar contract to the JMS MessageListener interface but also gives the message-handling method access to the JMS Session from which the Message was received. It can be used by MDPs if they want to respond to any received messages. All of the message listener container implementations that ship with Spring have support for MDPs that implement either the MessageListener or SessionAwareMessageListener interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/receiving.html)"
"What is the MessageListenerAdapter class and how is it used in Spring's asynchronous messaging support?","The MessageListenerAdapter class is a component in Spring's asynchronous messaging support that lets you expose almost any class as an MDP. It can automatically send back a response message if a handler method returns a non-void value. It can also automatically convert the return value into a TextMessage and send it to the Destination defined in the JMS Reply-To property of the original Message or the default Destination set on the MessageListenerAdapter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/receiving.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JmsMessageEndpointManager in Spring's JCA-based MessageListener container?","The JmsMessageEndpointManager is used to manage the lifecycle of a message listener and to provide a way to interact with the server-hosted ResourceAdapter. It is typically used with the JCA-based MessageListener container provided by Spring starting from version 2.5. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/jca-message-endpoint-manager.html)"
"How can you configure the target ResourceAdapter locally using Spring's ResourceAdapterFactoryBean?","You can configure the target ResourceAdapter locally using Spring's ResourceAdapterFactoryBean by setting the resourceAdapter property to a bean of the appropriate ResourceAdapter class and the workManager property to a bean of the SimpleTaskWorkManager class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/jca-message-endpoint-manager.html)"
"What is the difference between JmsActivationSpecConfig and a given ActivationSpec object in the JmsMessageEndpointManager?","JmsActivationSpecConfig is a generic configuration class provided by Spring for setting up the ActivationSpec object used by the JmsMessageEndpointManager. A given ActivationSpec object can also be used, and may come from a JNDI lookup. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/jca-message-endpoint-manager.html)"
"How can you receive a message asynchronously in Spring Boot using JMS?","You can use the annotated listener endpoint infrastructure. The @JmsListener annotation is used to expose a method of a managed bean as a JMS listener endpoint. The infrastructure creates a message listener container behind the scenes for each annotated method, by using a JmsListenerContainerFactory."
"How do you enable support for @JmsListener annotations in Spring Boot?","You can add @EnableJms to one of your @Configuration classes. By default, the infrastructure looks for a bean named jmsListenerContainerFactory as the source for the factory to use to create message listener containers."
"What is the purpose of the JmsListenerConfigurer interface in Spring Boot?","It allows you to customize the listener container factory to use for each annotation or you can configure an explicit default by implementing the JmsListenerConfigurer interface. The default is required only if at least one endpoint is registered without a specific container factory."
"What is the purpose of referencing the JMS schema in Spring?","Referencing the JMS schema in Spring is necessary to use the JMS namespace elements for simplifying JMS configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/namespace.html)"
"What are the three top-level elements in the JMS namespace?","The three top-level elements in the JMS namespace are <annotation-driven/>, <listener-container/>, and <jca-listener-container/>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/namespace.html)"
"What is the purpose of the <listener-container/> element in the JMS namespace?","The <listener-container/> element in the JMS namespace defines shared listener container configuration and can contain <listener/> child elements. It allows for customization of various strategies and basic JMS settings and resource references. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/namespace.html)"
"What is JMX and what are its features in Spring?","JMX stands for Java Management Extensions. It is a specification that allows you to monitor and manage resources in a Java application. In Spring, JMX provides features such as automatic registration of Spring beans as JMX MBeans, controlling the management interface of beans, exposure of MBeans over remote connectors, and proxying of local and remote MBean resources. These features are designed to work without coupling your application components to Spring or JMX interfaces and classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx.html)"
"How can you control the management interface of beans in Spring using JMX?","In Spring, you can control the management interface of your beans using a flexible mechanism provided by JMX. This mechanism allows you to define the attributes, operations, and notifications that are exposed to the JMX infrastructure. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx.html)"
"What is the purpose of exposing MBeans over remote connectors in Spring using JMX?","Exposing MBeans over remote connectors in Spring using JMX allows you to manage and monitor your Spring application from a remote location. This is achieved through the use of JSR-160 connectors, which provide a standard way to communicate with remote resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx.html)"
"What is the core class in Spring's JMX framework responsible for registering Spring beans with a JMX MBeanServer?","MBeanExporter (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/exporting.html)"
"How can you configure an instance of the MBeanExporter class to expose the properties and methods of a bean as attributes and operations of an MBean?","By passing the bean into the beans property of the MBeanExporter configuration. The default configuration uses the bean's ObjectName as the key in the beans Map. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/exporting.html)"
"What is the default registration behavior when an MBeanExporter attempts to register an MBean with an MBeanServer and an MBean instance has already been registered under the same ObjectName?","The default registration behavior is FAIL_ON_EXISTING, which means the MBean that is being registered is not registered, and an InstanceAlreadyExistsException is thrown. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/exporting.html)"
"How can you control the management interface of your beans in Spring JMX?","You can control the management interface of your beans in Spring JMX by using the MBeanInfoAssembler interface. This interface is responsible for defining the management interface of each bean that is exposed. The default implementation, org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.SimpleReflectiveMBeanInfoAssembler, defines a management interface that exposes all public properties and methods. Spring provides two additional implementations of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface: MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler and InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler."
"What is the MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler and how can it be used?","The MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler is one of the additional implementations of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface provided by Spring JMX. It allows you to control the generated management interface by using source-level metadata. The reading of metadata is encapsulated by the org.springframework.jmx.export.metadata.JmxAttributeSource interface. The MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler must be configured with an implementation instance of the JmxAttributeSource interface for it to function correctly. To mark a bean for export to JMX, you should annotate the bean class with the ManagedResource annotation. You must mark each method you wish to expose as an operation with the ManagedOperation annotation and mark each property you wish to expose with the ManagedAttribute annotation."
"What is the InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler and how can it be used?","The InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler is another additional implementation of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface provided by Spring JMX. It lets you constrain the methods and properties that are exposed based on the set of methods defined in a collection of interfaces. This interface is used to define a management interface for the bean, and it is not required for the bean to implement the interface used to generate the JMX management interface. The InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler can be configured to use a specific interface or multiple interfaces for different beans. It also removes the need for naming conventions and the need for beans to implement MBean interfaces."
"How can you have Spring JMX create, start, and expose a JSR-160 JMXConnectorServer?","You can use the following configuration: <bean id=""serverConnector"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.support.ConnectorServerFactoryBean""/> By default, ConnectorServerFactoryBean creates a JMXConnectorServer bound to service:jmx:jmxmp://localhost:9875. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/jsr160.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ObjectName property in the ConnectorServerFactoryBean?","If the ObjectName property is set, Spring automatically registers your connector with the MBeanServer under that ObjectName. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/jsr160.html)"
"How can you create an MBeanServerConnection to a remote JSR-160-enabled MBeanServer?","You can use the MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean, as the following example shows: <bean id=""clientConnector"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.support.MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean""><property name=""serviceUrl"" value=""service:jmx:rmi://localhost/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi""/></bean>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/jsr160.html)"
"How can I create a proxy for an MBean running in a local MBeanServer using Spring JMX?","You can create a proxy for an MBean running in a local MBeanServer using Spring JMX by using the MBeanProxyFactoryBean class. The proxy is configured with the objectName and proxyInterface properties. The objectName property specifies the ObjectName of the MBean to proxy, and the proxyInterface property specifies the interface that the proxy implements. The following code shows an example of how to configure a proxy for an MBean running in a local MBeanServer: <bean id=""proxy"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.access.MBeanProxyFactoryBean""> <property name=""objectName"" value=""bean:name=testBean""/> <property name=""proxyInterface"" value=""org.springframework.jmx.IJmxTestBean""/> </bean>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/proxy.html)"
"How can I create a proxy for an MBean running on a remote machine using Spring JMX?","To create a proxy for an MBean running on a remote machine using Spring JMX, you need to create an MBeanServerConnection that points to the remote machine using the MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean. This MBeanServerConnection is then passed to the MBeanProxyFactoryBean through the server property. The following code shows an example of how to create a proxy for an MBean running on a remote machine: <bean id=""clientConnector"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.support.MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean""> <property name=""serviceUrl"" value=""service:jmx:rmi://remotehost:9875""/> </bean> <bean id=""proxy"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.access.MBeanProxyFactoryBean""> <property name=""objectName"" value=""bean:name=testBean""/> <property name=""proxyInterface"" value=""org.springframework.jmx.IJmxTestBean""/> <property name=""server"" ref=""clientConnector""/> </bean>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/proxy.html)"
"What is the purpose of the proxyInterfaces property in the MBeanProxyFactoryBean class?","The proxyInterfaces property in the MBeanProxyFactoryBean class controls the set of interfaces that the proxy implements. This property is used to specify the interfaces that the proxy implements, and the rules for mapping methods and properties on these interfaces to operations and attributes on the MBean are the same rules used by the InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/proxy.html)"
"How can I register a NotificationListener with an MBean in Spring's JMX support?","You can register a NotificationListener with an MBean in Spring's JMX support by using the notificationListenerMappings property of the MBeanExporter bean. This property is a map that allows you to associate a NotificationListener with an MBean. You can also use straight bean names as the link between exported beans and listeners. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/notifications.html)"
"What is the purpose of the NotificationPublisher interface in Spring's JMX support?","The NotificationPublisher interface in Spring's JMX support is used to publish notifications. Any bean that is going to be exported as an MBean through an MBeanExporter instance can implement the related NotificationPublisherAware interface to gain access to a NotificationPublisher instance. The NotificationPublisherAware interface supplies an instance of a NotificationPublisher to the implementing bean through a simple setter method, which the bean can then use to publish notifications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/notifications.html)"
"How can I register a NotificationListener for all MBeans exported by an MBeanExporter in Spring's JMX support?","To register a NotificationListener for all MBeans exported by an MBeanExporter in Spring's JMX support, you can use the special wildcard (*) as the key for an entry in the notificationListenerMappings property map. This will register the specified NotificationListener for all MBeans exported by the MBeanExporter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/notifications.html)"

"What is the name of the hierarchy of checked exceptions that provide a higher level of abstraction over the lower level mail system exceptions in the Spring Framework's email support?","The hierarchy of checked exceptions that provide a higher level of abstraction over the lower level mail system exceptions in the Spring Framework's email support is MailException. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/email.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TaskExecutor and TaskScheduler interfaces in Spring Framework?","The TaskExecutor and TaskScheduler interfaces in Spring Framework provide abstractions for the asynchronous execution and scheduling of tasks, respectively. They support thread pools and delegation to CommonJ within an application server environment, abstracting away the differences between Java SE and Jakarta EE environments. Spring also features integration classes to support scheduling with the Quartz Scheduler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html)"
"What is the difference between a fixed-rate and a fixed-delay trigger in the Spring TaskScheduler Abstraction?","A fixed-rate trigger measures the period between the successive start times of each invocation, while a fixed-delay trigger measures the period from the completion time of each preceding invocation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html)"
"How can you manage exceptions in an @Async method with a void return type?","To manage exceptions in an @Async method with a void return type, you can provide an AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler. By default, the exception is logged, but you can define a custom AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework?","The Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework allows for the consistent use of various caching solutions with minimal impact on the code. It was introduced in version 3.1 and significantly extended in version 4.1 with support for JSR-107 annotations and more customization options. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html)"
"How can I add caching to an existing Spring application using the Cache Abstraction?","You can add caching to an existing Spring application using the Cache Abstraction by following the steps outlined in the 'Declarative Annotation-based Caching' and 'Declarative XML-based Caching' sections of the Spring Framework reference documentation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html)"
"What are some customization options available for the Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework?","The Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework offers various customization options, including support for JSR-107 annotations, configuring the cache storage, plugging in different back-end caches, and setting the TTL/TTI/Eviction policy/XXX feature. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html)"
"What is the traditional use of a buffer in computing?","The traditional use of a buffer in computing is to serve as an intermediate temporary store for data between a fast and a slow entity. It helps to alleviate performance issues by allowing entire blocks of data to move at once rather than in small chunks. The data is written and read only once from the buffer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/strategies.html)"
"How does the cache abstraction in Spring Boot improve the performance of Java methods?","The cache abstraction in Spring Boot improves the performance of Java methods by applying caching to them, reducing the number of executions based on the information available in the cache. Each time a targeted method is invoked, the abstraction applies a caching behavior that checks whether the method has been already invoked for the given arguments. If it has been invoked, the cached result is returned without having to invoke the actual method. If the method has not been invoked, then it is invoked, and the result is cached and returned to the user so that, the next time the method is invoked, the cached result is returned. This way, expensive methods (whether CPU- or IO-bound) can be invoked only once for a given set of parameters and the result reused without having to actually invoke the method again. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/strategies.html)"
"What are the cache-related operations provided by the caching abstraction in Spring Boot?","The caching abstraction in Spring Boot provides other cache-related operations, such as the ability to update the content of the cache or to remove one or all entries. These operations are useful if the cache deals with data that can change during the course of the application. The caching abstraction also provides the ability to identify the methods that need to be cached and their policies, and to configure the backing cache where the data is stored and from which it is read. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/strategies.html)"
"How does Spring's caching abstraction provide a set of Java annotations for caching declaration?","Spring's caching abstraction provides a set of Java annotations for caching declaration, including @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, @Caching, and @CacheConfig. These annotations are used to trigger cache population, eviction, and updates, as well as to share common cache-related settings at the class level. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Cacheable annotation in Spring's caching abstraction?","The @Cacheable annotation in Spring's caching abstraction triggers cache population. It is used to demarcate methods that are cacheable, meaning that the result of the method is stored in the cache so that subsequent invocations with the same arguments can return the value from the cache without having to invoke the method again. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/annotations.html)"
"How can you specify how the key is generated for a method annotated with @Cacheable?","To specify how the key is generated for a method annotated with @Cacheable, you can use the key attribute of the annotation. You can use Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to pick the arguments of interest, perform operations, or even invoke arbitrary methods without having to write any code or implement any interface. This approach is recommended over the default generator, as it allows for more flexibility and customization. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/annotations.html)"
"What are the JCache (JSR-107) annotations supported by Spring's caching abstraction since version 4.1?","@CacheResult, @CachePut, @CacheRemove, and @CacheRemoveAll as well as the @CacheDefaults, @CacheKey, and @CacheValue companions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/jsr-107.html)"
"Can you use JSR-107 annotations without migrating your cache store to JSR-107?","Yes, you can use these annotations even without migrating your cache store to JSR-107. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/jsr-107.html)"
"What is the main difference between the Spring @Cacheable annotation and the JSR-107 @CacheResult annotation?","The main difference is that @CacheResult can cache specific exceptions and force the execution of the method regardless of the content of the cache. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/jsr-107.html)"
"What is an alternative to annotation-based caching in Spring Boot?","Declarative XML-based caching is an alternative to annotation-based caching in Spring Boot. This approach allows you to specify the target method and caching directives externally, similar to declarative transaction management advice. It's useful when you have no access to the sources or no external code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/declarative-xml.html)"
"How do you make a service cacheable using declarative XML-based caching in Spring Boot?","To make a service cacheable using declarative XML-based caching in Spring Boot, you need to define the service bean, cache definitions, cache advice, and apply the cache advice to the appropriate points in the program using the AspectJ pointcut expression. In the example, the bookService is made cacheable by encapsulating the caching semantics in the cache:advice definition and applying the cache advice to the BookService interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/declarative-xml.html)"
"What are the benefits of using declarative XML-based caching over annotation-based caching in Spring Boot?","Declarative XML-based caching in Spring Boot supports all of the annotation-based model and can be used inside the same application. It does not touch the target code, making it easier to apply package or group or interface-wide caching. Additionally, it allows for the creation of template-like definitions. However, it is inherently more verbose compared to annotation-based caching. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/declarative-xml.html)"
"How do you configure the JDK ConcurrentMap-based Cache in Spring Boot?","To configure the JDK ConcurrentMap-based Cache in Spring Boot, you need to declare an appropriate CacheManager and use the ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean to create a CacheManager for the two nested ConcurrentMapCache instances named default and books. The following example shows how to do this: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.support.SimpleCacheManager""> <property name=""caches""> <set> <bean class=""org.springframework.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean"" p:name=""default""/> <bean class=""org.springframework.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean"" p:name=""books""/> </set> </property> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/store-configuration.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Caffeine CacheManager in Spring Boot?","The Caffeine CacheManager in Spring Boot creates a CacheManager that creates the cache on demand. It also supports custom Caffeine and CacheLoader. The following example configures a CacheManager that creates the cache on demand: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.caffeine.CaffeineCacheManager""/> You can also provide the caches to use explicitly. In that case, only those are made available by the manager. The following example shows how to do so: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.caffeine.CaffeineCacheManager""> <property name=""cacheNames""> <set> <value>default</value> <value>books</value> </set> </property> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/store-configuration.html)"
"What is the purpose of the CompositeCacheManager in Spring Boot?","The CompositeCacheManager in Spring Boot chains multiple CacheManager instances and, through the fallbackToNoOpCache flag, adds a no-op cache for all the definitions not handled by the configured cache managers. This is useful when switching environments or doing testing, and you might have cache declarations without having an actual backing cache configured. The following example shows how to use the CompositeCacheManager: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.support.CompositeCacheManager""> <property name=""cacheManagers""> <list> <ref bean=""jdkCache""/> <ref bean=""gemfireCache""/> </list> </property> <property name=""fallbackToNoOpCache"" value=""true""/> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/store-configuration.html)"
"What is the purpose of adapters in the context of caching abstraction frameworks?","Adapters in the context of caching abstraction frameworks map the caching abstraction framework on top of the storage API, as the Caffeine classes do. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/plug.html)"
"How can developers simplify the implementation of CacheManager classes for caching products that do not support JSR-107?","Developers can use the classes in the org.springframework.cache.support package, such as AbstractCacheManager, which takes care of the boiler-plate code, leaving only the actual mapping to be completed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/plug.html)"
"What is the main challenge in using different back-end caches with Spring Boot?","The main challenge in using different back-end caches with Spring Boot is that some caching products do not support JSR-107, requiring developers to provide a CacheManager and a Cache implementation. However, this can be simplified by using adapters and classes in the org.springframework.cache.support package. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/plug.html)"
"How can I set the Time To Live (TTL) or Time To Idle (TTI) for cache entries in Spring Boot?","You can set the TTL or TTI for cache entries directly through your cache provider. The cache abstraction in Spring Boot is an abstraction, not a cache implementation, so the specific data policies and topologies supported by your chosen cache provider should be controlled directly through the backing cache or its native API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/specific-config.html)"
"Can I configure eviction policies for my cache entries in Spring Boot's cache abstraction?","No, you cannot configure eviction policies directly through Spring Boot's cache abstraction. Instead, you should control eviction policies directly through your chosen cache provider or its native API when configuring the backing cache. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/specific-config.html)"
"Is it possible to set different cache configurations for different cache types in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can set different cache configurations for different cache types in Spring Boot. Since the cache abstraction is an abstraction and not a cache implementation, you should configure the specific data policies and topologies supported by your chosen cache provider directly through the backing cache or its native API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/specific-config.html)"
"What is the concept of Observation in Micrometer and how does it support both Metrics and Traces?","The concept of Observation in Micrometer enables both Metrics and Traces in applications. Metrics support offers a way to create timers, gauges, or counters for collecting statistics about the runtime behavior of your application. Traces provide a holistic view of an entire system, crossing application boundaries; you can zoom in on particular user requests and follow their entire completion across applications. (Source: https://docs.micrometer.io/micrometer/reference/observation.html)"
"How can you customize the metadata produced with the Spring MVC ""http.server.requests"" metrics instrumentation?","You can extend the DefaultServerRequestObservationConvention for your requirements. If you want full control, you can implement the entire convention contract for the observation you're interested in. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/observability.html)"
"How do you configure an ObservationRegistry on the WebClient builder to enable the instrumentation?","Applications must configure an ObservationRegistry on the WebClient builder to enable the instrumentation; without that, observations are 'no-ops'. Spring Boot will auto-configure WebClient.Builder beans with the observation registry already set. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/observability.html)"
"What is CDS and how can it benefit Java applications?","CDS stands for Class Data Sharing, a JVM feature that can help reduce the startup time and memory footprint of Java applications. It does this by creating an archive of classes that can be shared among multiple instances of the JVM. This can be particularly useful for applications with large classpaths or that are frequently started and stopped. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cds.html)"
"How do I create a CDS archive for my Spring application?","To create a CDS archive for a Spring application, you need to specify two additional JVM flags: -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=application.jsa and -Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh. These flags will cause the application to exit automatically after the ApplicationContext has refreshed, allowing the CDS archive to be created. The JDK/JRE must have a base image, and if you get a warning about the base CDS archive not being loaded, you can create it using the command $ java -Xshare:dump. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cds.html)"
"How do I use the CDS archive I've created for my Spring application?","To use the CDS archive you've created, add the JVM flag -XX:SharedArchiveFile=application.jsa to your startup script, assuming an application.jsa file in the working directory. You can also use -Xshare:on to check if the CDS cache is effective. To figure out how effective the cache is, enable class loading logs by adding an extra attribute: -Xlog:class+load:file=cds.log. This creates a cds.log with every attempt to load a class and its source. Classes that are loaded from the cache should have a ""shared objects file"" source. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cds.html)"
"What is the purpose of the jee elements in Spring XML configuration files?","The jee elements deal with issues related to Jakarta EE (Enterprise Edition) configuration, such as looking up a JNDI object and defining EJB references.

"What are the Kotlin dependencies required for Spring Framework?","The Kotlin dependencies required for Spring Framework are kotlin-stdlib and kotlin-reflect. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/requirements.html)"
"Is the Jackson Kotlin module required for all Spring Framework projects?","No, the Jackson Kotlin module is only required if you need to serialize or deserialize JSON data for Kotlin classes with Jackson. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/requirements.html)"
"What are Kotlin extensions and how do they benefit the Spring Framework?","Kotlin extensions are a feature of the Kotlin programming language that allow developers to add new functionality to existing classes. In the context of the Spring Framework, these extensions provide Kotlin-specific conveniences to existing Spring APIs. They improve the Kotlin development experience by offering shorter syntax and better type inference. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"How do you use Kotlin extensions in the Spring Framework?","To use Kotlin extensions in the Spring Framework, you need to import them. This can usually be done automatically by your IDE. Once imported, you can use the extensions in your code to simplify and improve the Kotlin API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"What is the advantage of using Kotlin's reified type parameters in the Spring Framework?","Kotlin's reified type parameters provide a workaround for JVM generics type erasure, which is a limitation of Java's type system. This allows for a better Kotlin API in the Spring Framework, as it enables stronger type checking and better type inference. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"How does the Spring Framework support instantiating Kotlin classes through primary constructors?","The Spring Framework supports instantiating Kotlin classes through primary constructors by using the @Autowired annotation on the constructor parameters. This allows for automatic wiring of dependencies when creating instances of Kotlin classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/classes-interfaces.html)"
"What is the purpose of the KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer in Spring Framework?","The KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer is used in the Spring Framework to find interface method parameter names without requiring the Java 8 -parameters compiler flag to be enabled during compilation. This allows for better parameter name exposure in Kotlin interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/classes-interfaces.html)"
"What are the restrictions on declaring configuration classes in Kotlin in the Spring Framework?","Configuration classes in Kotlin cannot be declared as inner classes in the Spring Framework. This is because inner classes require a reference to the outer class, which is not supported by the Spring Framework. Configuration classes can be declared as top level or nested, but not inner. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/classes-interfaces.html)"
"How does Spring Framework use Kotlin null-safety to determine if an HTTP parameter is required?","Spring Framework uses Kotlin null-safety to determine if an HTTP parameter is required by treating @RequestParam name: String? as not required and @RequestParam name: String as required. This feature is also supported on the Spring Messaging @Header annotation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/annotations.html)"
"How does the use of lateinit and nullable types affect Spring bean injection?","The use of lateinit and nullable types in Spring bean injection affects whether a bean is required or not. For example, @Autowired lateinit var thing: Thing implies that a bean of type Thing must be registered in the application context, while @Autowired lateinit var thing: Thing? does not raise an error if such a bean does not exist. Similarly, @Bean fun play(toy: Toy, car: Car?) = Baz(toy, Car) implies that a bean of type Toy must be registered, while a bean of type Car may or may not exist. The same behavior applies to autowired constructor parameters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/annotations.html)"
"What should you consider when using bean validation on classes with properties or a primary constructor parameter in Kotlin?","When using bean validation on classes with properties or a primary constructor parameter in Kotlin, you may need to use annotation use-site targets, such as @field:NotNull or @get:Size(min=5, max=15), as described in this Stack Overflow response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/annotations.html, https://stackoverflow.com/a/35853200/1092077)"
"What is the Bean Definition DSL in Spring Framework and how does it work?","The Bean Definition DSL in Spring Framework is a Kotlin-specific feature that allows developers to register beans in a functional way using lambdas. This is an alternative to XML or Java configuration. It lets you register beans with a lambda that acts as a FactoryBean. This mechanism is very efficient, as it does not require any reflection or CGLIB proxies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/bean-definition-dsl.html)"
"How does the Bean Definition DSL in Spring Framework handle autowiring of parameters?","When specifying bean<Bar>() or bean(::myRouter), parameters are autowired by type. This means that the framework automatically injects the required dependencies into the constructor or setter methods of the bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/bean-definition-dsl.html)"
"Can the Bean Definition DSL be used with Spring Boot?","Spring Boot is based on JavaConfig and does not yet provide specific support for functional bean definition. However, you can experimentally use functional bean definitions through Spring Boot’s ApplicationContextInitializer support. See this Stack Overflow answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45935931/how-to-use-functional-bean-definition-kotlin-dsl-with-spring-boot-and-spring-w/46033685#46033685) for more details and up-to-date information. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/bean-definition-dsl.html)"
"What are the three flavors of Kotlin router DSL available in Spring Framework?","WebMvc.fn DSL, WebFlux.fn Reactive DSL, and WebFlux.fn Coroutines DSL. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/web.html)"
"How does the programmatic Kotlin router DSL allow for custom registration logic of beans?","Through the use of if expressions, for loops, or any other Kotlin constructs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/web.html)"
"What is the name of the Kotlin DSL provided via MockMvc Kotlin extensions, and what does it aim to achieve?","The MockMvc DSL aims to provide a more idiomatic Kotlin API and better discoverability by avoiding static methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/web.html)"
"What is the main difference between Flow and Flux in the context of Coroutines?","Flow is push-based while Flux is push-pull hybrid. Flow has only a single suspending collect method and operators are implemented as extensions. Operators are easy to implement thanks to Coroutines. Extensions allow to add custom operators to Flow. Collect operations are suspending functions and the map operator supports asynchronous operation since it takes a suspending function parameter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/coroutines.html)"
"How can I define a Coroutines router using the coRouter DSL and related handlers?","You can define a Coroutines router using the coRouter DSL and related handlers by creating a @Configuration class with a @Bean function that returns the coRouter. Inside the coRouter, you can define the routes and their corresponding handlers. The handlers should be defined as suspending functions that take a ServerRequest parameter and return a ServerResponse. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/coroutines.html)"
"How can I use transactions with Coroutines in Spring?","You can use transactions with Coroutines in Spring by using the programmatic variant of the Reactive transaction management provided as of Spring Framework 5.2. For suspending functions, you can use the TransactionalOperator.executeAndAwait extension. For Kotlin Flow, you can use the Flow.transactional extension. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/coroutines.html)"
"What is the default behavior of classes and member functions in Kotlin, and how does it affect Spring projects?","By default, all classes and member functions in Kotlin are final. This means they cannot be inherited from or overridden in subclasses. This can cause issues in Spring projects, where classes and functions may need to be overridden. To overcome this, the open modifier can be used to allow inheritance and overriding. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/spring-projects-in.html)"
"How can you avoid CGLIB proxies for configuration classes in Spring projects using Kotlin?","To avoid CGLIB proxies for configuration classes in Spring projects using Kotlin, you can use the @Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) annotation. This annotation tells Spring not to create a CGLIB proxy for the configuration class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/spring-projects-in.html)"
"What is the kotlin-spring compiler plugin and how does it help with Spring projects in Kotlin?","The kotlin-spring compiler plugin is a preconfigured version of the kotlin-allopen plugin that automatically opens classes and their member functions for types annotated or meta-annotated with certain Spring annotations. This plugin helps to automatically open classes and their member functions for types that are annotated or meta-annotated with one of the following annotations: @Component, @Async, @Transactional, @Cacheable. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/spring-projects-in.html)"
"How can I learn to build a Spring application with Kotlin?","The easiest way is to follow the dedicated tutorial available at https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/ (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/getting-started.html)"
"How can I start a new Spring Framework project in Kotlin?","You can create a new Spring Boot project on start.spring.io by selecting Kotlin as the language and Gradle as the build tool. The URL for this is https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin&type=gradle-project-kotlin (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/getting-started.html)"
"Which web stack should I use when creating a Spring application - Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux?","Spring WebFlux is recommended for applications dealing with latency, long-lived connections or streaming scenarios. However, for other use cases, especially when using blocking technologies like JPA, Spring MVC is the recommended choice. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/getting-started.html)"
"What is the recommended resource for learning the Kotlin language?","The recommended resource for learning the Kotlin language is the Kotlin language reference available at <https://kotlinlang.org/docs>. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/resources.html>)"
"How can I connect with other Kotlin developers for support and discussions?","You can connect with other Kotlin developers through the Kotlin Slack at <https://slack.kotlinlang.org/>, which has a dedicated #spring channel. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/resources.html>)"
"Where can I find examples of applications built with Kotlin and the Spring Framework?","You can find examples of applications built with Kotlin and the Spring Framework by exploring the following Github projects: tut-spring-boot-kotlin at <https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-spring-boot-kotlin>, spring-boot-kotlin-demo at <https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-boot-kotlin-demo>, mixit at <https://github.com/mixitconf/mixit>, spring-kotlin-functional at <https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-functional>, spring-kotlin-fullstack at <https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-fullstack>, and spring-petclinic-kotlin at <https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-kotlin>. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/resources.html>)"
"What is Groovy in the context of the Spring Framework?","Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed, and dynamic language that offers a concise syntax and seamless integration with any existing Java application. It has static-typing and static compilation capabilities. In the Spring Framework, Groovy is supported by a dedicated ApplicationContext that provides a Groovy-based Bean Definition DSL. For more information, visit https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/groovy.html."
"How does the Spring Framework support Groovy-based beans?","The Spring Framework supports Groovy-based beans through a dedicated ApplicationContext that provides a Groovy-based Bean Definition DSL. This allows for the definition of beans using the Groovy language. For more information, visit https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/groovy.html."
"What additional features does the Spring Framework provide for Groovy support?","In addition to supporting Groovy-based beans, the Spring Framework also provides further support for Groovy, including refreshable script beans and more. For more information, visit https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/groovy.html."
"What is the main advantage of using dynamic language support in Spring?","The main advantage of using dynamic language support in Spring is the ability to use classes and objects defined by dynamic languages like Groovy, BeanShell, and JSR-223 capable languages such as JRuby. This support allows for transparent instantiation, configuration, and dependency injection of dynamic language objects by the Spring container."
"What is the difference between constructor injection and setter injection in the context of dynamic-language-backed beans?","Constructor injection is not available for dynamic-language-backed beans in Spring. Instead, setter injection is the preferred injection style for dynamic-language-backed beans."
"How can you customize Groovy objects using a callback in Spring?","You can customize Groovy objects by implementing the GroovyObjectCustomizer interface, which provides a callback that allows you to hook additional creation logic into the process of creating a Groovy-backed bean. This interface can be used to invoke initialization methods, set default property values, or specify a custom MetaClass."
"What is the purpose of the SpringProperties class in the Spring Framework?","The SpringProperties class is a static holder for properties that control certain low-level aspects of the Spring Framework. Users can configure these properties via JVM system properties or programmatically via the SpringProperties.setProperty(String key, String value) method. The latter may be necessary if the deployment environment disallows custom JVM system properties. As an alternative, these properties may be configured in a spring.properties file in the root of the classpath — for example, deployed within the application’s JAR file. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/appendix.html)"
"What is the 'spring.aot.enabled' property used for in the Spring Framework?","The 'spring.aot.enabled' property is used to indicate the application should run with AOT generated artifacts. See Ahead of Time Optimizations(core/aot.html) and AotDetector(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aot/AotDetector.html#AOT_ENABLED) for details. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/appendix.html)"
"What is the 'spring.beaninfo.ignore' property used for in the Spring Framework?","The 'spring.beaninfo.ignore' property instructs Spring to use the Introspector.IGNORE_ALL_BEANINFO mode when calling the JavaBeans Introspector. See CachedIntrospectionResults(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/StandardBeanInfoFactory.html#IGNORE_BEANINFO_PROPERTY_NAME) for details. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/appendix.html)"
