"How can I define query methods in a JPA repository?","You can define query methods in a JPA repository by using the @Query annotation and specifying the JPQL query within it. You can also use the @Modifying annotation to indicate that the method modifies the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa.html#repositories.query-methods.details)"
"What is the difference between Spring Data JPA and Hibernate?","Spring Data JPA is a Java Persistence API (JPA) implementation provided by Spring, while Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework. Hibernate is one of the many JPA implementations that can be used with Spring Data JPA. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa.html#jpa-vs-hibernate)"
"How can I easily bootstrap a working Spring environment?","You can create a Spring-based project via start.spring.io(https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&dependencies=h2,data-jpa) or create a Spring project in Spring Tools(https://spring.io/tools) (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/getting-started.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/getting-started.html)"
"What is the simplest way to get started with a Hello World example using Spring Data JPA?","Create an @Entity class (e.g., Person), a corresponding repository interface (e.g., PersonRepository), and a main application that uses Spring Boot to run the application. The basic repository extends Repository, and you can consider using ListCrudRepository or JpaRepository for more complex use cases. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/getting-started.html)"
"What is the central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction?","The central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction is Repository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the two interfaces that provide CRUD functionality in Spring Data?","The two interfaces that provide CRUD functionality in Spring Data are CrudRepository and ListCrudRepository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the methods declared in the CrudRepository interface?","The methods declared in the CrudRepository interface are save, findById, findAll, count, delete, and existsById. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"How can you define a repository interface in Spring Data JPA?","To define a repository interface, you first need to define a domain class-specific repository interface. The interface must extend Repository and be typed to the domain class and an ID type. If you want to expose CRUD methods for that domain type, you may extend CrudRepository, or one of its variants instead of Repository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"What are the different variants of repository interfaces in Spring Data JPA?","There are a few variants how you can get started with your repository interface. The typical approach is to extend CrudRepository, which gives you methods for CRUD functionality. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. With version 3.0 we also introduced ListCrudRepository which is very similar to the CrudRepository but for those methods that return multiple entities it returns a List instead of an Iterable which you might find easier to use. If you are using a reactive store you might choose ReactiveCrudRepository, or RxJava3CrudRepository depending on which reactive framework you are using. If you are using Kotlin you might pick CoroutineCrudRepository which utilizes Kotlin’s coroutines. Additional you can extend PagingAndSortingRepository, ReactiveSortingRepository, RxJava3SortingRepository, or CoroutineSortingRepository if you need methods that allow to specify a Sort abstraction or in the first case a Pageable abstraction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How can you selectively expose CRUD methods in your repository interface?","If you prefer to be selective about the methods being exposed, copy the methods you want to expose from the CRUD repository into your domain repository. When doing so, you may change the return type of methods. Spring Data will honor the return type if possible. For example, for methods returning multiple entities you may choose Iterable<T>, List<T>, Collection<T> or a VAVR list. If many repositories in your application should have the same set of methods you can define your own base interface to inherit from. Such an interface must be annotated with @NoRepositoryBean. This prevents Spring Data to try to create an instance of it directly and failing because it can’t determine the entity for that repository, since it still contains a generic type variable. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How can Spring Data JPA repositories be configured through Java configuration?","Spring Data JPA repositories can be configured through Java configuration by using the @Configuration annotation, the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation, and the @EnableTransactionManagement annotation. Additionally, a LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean should be created and not EntityManagerFactory directly. The preceding configuration class sets up an embedded HSQL database by using the EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder API of spring-jdbc. Spring Data then sets up an EntityManagerFactory and uses Hibernate as the sample persistence provider. The last infrastructure component declared here is the JpaTransactionManager. Finally, the example activates Spring Data JPA repositories by using the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation, which essentially carries the same attributes as the XML namespace. If no base package is configured, it uses the one in which the configuration class resides. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/create-instances.html>)"
"What is the advantage of using JavaConfig over XML for configuring Spring Data JPA repositories?","Using JavaConfig for configuring Spring Data JPA repositories offers several advantages over XML. It allows for a more concise and readable configuration, as well as better integration with other Java-based frameworks and libraries. Additionally, it enables the use of annotations and other modern Java features, such as record types. New projects typically use as much pure Java as possible, and while there is no immediate plan to remove XML support, some of the newest features MAY not be available through XML. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/create-instances.html>)"
"What is the difference between LAZY and DEFERRED bootstrap modes in Spring Data JPA repositories?","The LAZY and DEFERRED bootstrap modes in Spring Data JPA repositories differ in their initialization and verification timing. LAZY mode declares all repository beans as lazy and creates lazy initialization proxies to be injected into client beans. Repository instances will be initialized and verified upon first interaction with the repository. DEFERRED mode is similar to LAZY mode, but triggers repository initialization in response to a ContextRefreshedEvent, ensuring that repositories are verified before the application has completely started. The default bootstrap mode is DEFAULT, which instantiates repositories eagerly unless explicitly annotated with @Lazy. DEFERRED is a reasonable default for asynchronous JPA bootstrap scenarios, as it ensures proper initialization and validation before the application signals it's up. LAZY is suitable for testing and local development scenarios where unnecessary verification can be avoided. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/create-instances.html>)"
"How can you persist or save entities using Spring Data JPA?","You can persist or save entities using the CrudRepository.save(…) method in Spring Data JPA. This method either persists or merges the given entity by using the underlying JPA EntityManager. If the entity has not yet been persisted, Spring Data JPA saves the entity with a call to the entityManager.persist(…) method. Otherwise, it calls the entityManager.merge(…) method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/entity-persistence.html)"
"How does Spring Data JPA determine whether an entity is new or not?","Spring Data JPA offers several strategies to detect whether an entity is new or not. By default, it first checks if there is a Version-property of non-primitive type. If there is, the entity is considered new if the value of that property is null. Without such a Version-property, Spring Data JPA inspects the identifier property of the given entity. If the identifier property is null, then the entity is assumed to be new. Otherwise, it is assumed to be not new. You can also implement the Persistable interface or customize the EntityInformation abstraction for more control over new detection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/entity-persistence.html)"
"What is an example of a common pattern for entities with manually assigned identifiers and no version attribute?","A common pattern for entities with manually assigned identifiers and no version attribute is to use a common base class with a transient flag defaulting to indicate a new instance and using JPA lifecycle callbacks to flip that flag on persistence operations. This can be achieved by creating an abstract class that implements Persistable and using @PrePersist and @PostLoad annotations to switch the flag to indicate an existing entity after a repository call to save(…) or an instance creation by the persistence provider. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/entity-persistence.html)"
"What are the three available options for query lookup strategies in Spring Data repository infrastructure?","The three available options for query lookup strategies in Spring Data repository infrastructure are CREATE, USE_DECLARED_QUERY, and CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-lookup-strategies)"
"How can you define constraints on entity properties in Spring Data repository query methods?","To define constraints on entity properties in Spring Data repository query methods, you can use the property expressions in the query method names. Property expressions can refer to a direct property of the managed entity or nested properties. You can also use operators like Between, LessThan, GreaterThan, and Like for property expressions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-creation)"
"What are the possible query method return types in Spring Data repository?","The possible query method return types in Spring Data repository include List, Set, and Iterable, as well as Streamable, custom wrapper types, and Vavr collections. You can also use Stream and CompletableFuture for asynchronous queries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.return-types)"

This can be helpful for debugging and performance optimization. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/query-methods.html#jpa.query-methods.meta-annotations)"
"How can I apply query hints in Spring Data JPA?","To apply JPA query hints in Spring Data JPA, you can use the @QueryHints annotation. This annotation takes an array of JPA @QueryHint annotations and a boolean flag to potentially disable the hints applied to the additional count query triggered when applying pagination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/query-methods.html#jpa.query-methods.query-hints)"
"What is the difference between a derived delete query and a manual delete query in Spring Data JPA?","A derived delete query is a shortcut for running the query and then calling CrudRepository.delete(Iterable<User> users) on the result and keeping behavior in sync with the implementations of other delete(…) methods in CrudRepository. On the other hand, a manual delete query runs a query and then deletes the returned instances one by one, so that the persistence provider can actually invoke @PreRemove callbacks on those entities. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/query-methods.html#jpa.query-methods.deleting)"
"What is the purpose of projections in Spring Data?","Projections in Spring Data are used to create views of the managed aggregates, returning partial views of the entities based on certain attributes. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html>)"
"What is the difference between class-based and interface-based projections in Spring Data?","Class-based projections are types residing outside the entity's type hierarchy, while interface-based projections are interfaces that expose accessor methods for the properties to be read. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html>)"
"How can you include nested projections in Spring Data?","To include nested projections, create a projection interface for the nested object and return that interface from the declaration of the nested property.

"How can you configure metadata for stored procedures in JPA?","Metadata for stored procedures can be configured by using the NamedStoredProcedureQuery annotation on an entity type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/stored-procedures.html)"
"What is the difference between the name and procedureName attributes in the @NamedStoredProcedureQuery annotation?","The name attribute is the name JPA uses, while the procedureName attribute is the name the stored procedure has in the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/stored-procedures.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JPA 2 criteria API?","The JPA 2 criteria API allows you to build queries programmatically. By writing a criteria, you define the where clause of a query for a domain class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/specifications.html)"
"What is the role of the Specification interface in Spring Data JPA?","The Specification interface is used to define predicates over an entity that can be combined and used with JpaRepository without the need to declare a query for every needed combination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/specifications.html)"
"How can you use a Specification to delete entries in JPA 2.1?","You can use the `delete(Specification)` API provided by JpaSpecificationExecutor to delete entries based on a Specification. The Specification builds up a criteria, which is then used to generate the right DELETE operation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/specifications.html)"
"What is Query by Example (QBE) and how does it work?","Query by Example (QBE) is a user-friendly querying technique with a simple interface that allows dynamic query creation and does not require you to write queries that contain field names. It does not require you to write queries by using store-specific query languages at all. QBE uses a probe, which is an actual example of a domain object with populated fields, and an ExampleMatcher, which carries details on how to match particular fields. An Example consists of the probe and the ExampleMatcher and is used to create the query. A FetchableFluentQuery offers a fluent API that allows further customization of a query derived from an Example. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the limitations of Query by Example?","Query by Example has several limitations, including no support for nested or grouped property constraints, such as firstname = ?0 or (firstname = ?1 and lastname = ?2). Store-specific support on string matching may be limited, depending on the database. Exact matching is supported for other property types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"How can you customize the matching behavior in Query by Example?","You can specify your own defaults for string matching, null handling, and property-specific settings by using the ExampleMatcher. You can also tune it with matching options and case sensitivity for individual properties. Settings on a property path have higher precedence than default settings. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"What is the default transaction configuration for methods inherited from CrudRepository?","The default transaction configuration for methods inherited from CrudRepository is determined by SimpleJpaRepository. For read operations, the transaction configuration readOnly flag is set to true. All other methods are configured with a plain @Transactional so that default transaction configuration applies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/transactions.html)"
"How can you customize transaction configuration for a specific method in a repository?","To customize transaction configuration for a specific method in a repository, you can redeclare the method in your repository interface with the desired transaction attributes, such as timeout and readOnly flag. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/transactions.html)"
"How can you define transaction boundaries for non-CRUD operations using a facade or service implementation?","You can define transaction boundaries for non-CRUD operations by using a facade or service implementation that covers more than one repository. This can be done by declaring the facade or service implementation with the @Transactional annotation, which causes the method calls within the facade to run inside a transaction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/transactions.html)"
"How can you specify the lock mode to be used in Spring Data JPA?","You can use the @Lock annotation on query methods or redeclare CRUD methods in your repository interface and add the @Lock annotation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/locking.html)"

"How can I benefit from auditing functionality provided by Spring Data?","To benefit from auditing functionality provided by Spring Data, you need to equip your entity classes with auditing metadata that can be defined either using annotations or by implementing an interface. Additionally, auditing has to be enabled either through Annotation configuration or XML configuration to register the required infrastructure components. Please refer to the store-specific section for configuration samples. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/auditing.html)"
"What is the difference between annotation-based and interface-based auditing metadata in Spring Data?","Annotation-based auditing metadata uses @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, @CreatedDate, and @LastModifiedDate to capture the user who created or modified the entity and when the change happened. Interface-based auditing metadata involves letting your domain class implement the Auditable interface, which exposes setter methods for all of the auditing properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/auditing.html)"
"How can I make my application aware of the current principal for @CreatedBy or @LastModifiedBy in Spring Data?","To make your application aware of the current principal for @CreatedBy or @LastModifiedBy, you need to implement the AuditorAware<T> SPI interface, which tells the infrastructure who the current user or system interacting with the application is. The generic type T defines what type the properties annotated with @CreatedBy or @LastModifiedBy have to be. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/auditing.html)"
