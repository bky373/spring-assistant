Excerpts provide a default preview of collection data, but not when fetching individual resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"
"How does Spring Data REST handle the representation of domain objects in HTTP requests?","Spring Data REST returns a representation of a domain object that corresponds to the Accept type specified in the HTTP request. Currently, only JSON representations are supported. Other representation types can be supported in the future by adding an appropriate converter and updating the controller methods with the appropriate content-type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"What happens when the behavior of the Spring Data REST ObjectMapper does not handle a domain model correctly?","If your domain model does not easily lend itself to reading or writing plain JSON, you may want to configure Jackson's ObjectMapper with your own custom mappings, serializers, and deserializers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"How can you register your own custom mappings, serializers, and deserializers with Jackson's ObjectMapper in Spring Data REST?","To add your own Jackson configuration to the ObjectMapper used by Spring Data REST, override the configureJacksonObjectMapper method.

You can register your own modules as well, as the example shows. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ETag header in Spring Data REST?","The ETag header provides a way to tag resources, preventing clients from overriding each other and reducing unnecessary calls. It can be used to conditionally perform PUT, PATCH, or DELETE operations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"How can the If-None-Match header be used to optimize data retrieval?","The If-None-Match header can be used to conditionally retrieve resources, allowing applications to avoid resending the same data. If the header matches the server-side version, Spring Data REST sends back an HTTP 304 Not Modified status code instead of sending a copy of the resource. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Version annotation in Spring Data REST?","The @Version annotation flags a field as a version marker. When used with a POJO served up as a REST resource by Spring Data REST, the ETag header is set to the value of the version field. This allows for conditional updates and prevents clients from stomping on each other. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"What are the eight different events emitted by the REST exporter when working with an entity?","The eight different events emitted by the REST exporter are: BeforeCreateEvent, AfterCreateEvent, BeforeSaveEvent, AfterSaveEvent, BeforeLinkSaveEvent, AfterLinkSaveEvent, BeforeDeleteEvent, and AfterDeleteEvent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you subclass an abstract class to listen for these kinds of events and call the appropriate method based on the event type?","To subclass an abstract class that listens for these kinds of events, you can extend the AbstractRepositoryEventListener class and override the methods for the events in question. For example: public class BeforeSaveEventListener extends AbstractRepositoryEventListener { @Override public void onBeforeSave(Object entity) { ... logic to handle inspecting the entity before the Repository saves it } @Override public void onAfterDelete(Object entity) { ... send a message that this entity has been deleted } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you use an annotated handler to filter events based on domain type?","To use an annotated handler, you can create a POJO and put the @RepositoryEventHandler annotation on it. This tells the BeanPostProcessor that this class needs to be inspected for handler methods. Once the BeanPostProcessor finds a bean with this annotation, it iterates over the exposed methods and looks for annotations that correspond to the event in question. To handle BeforeSaveEvent instances in an annotated POJO for different kinds of domain types, you could define your class as follows: @RepositoryEventHandler public class PersonEventHandler { @HandleBeforeSave public void handlePersonSave(Person p) { // … you can now deal with Person in a type-safe way } @HandleBeforeSave public void handleProfileSave(Profile p) { // … you can now deal with Profile in a type-safe way } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"

The following example shows how to secure your Spring Data REST services with method-level security using the PreAuthorization model: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html#security-method-level-security"
"What is the difference between repository-level and method-level security settings in Spring Data REST?","Repository and method-level security settings do not combine. Instead, method-level settings override repository-level settings. This means that if you want to change the security settings for a specific method, you must override the method signature and apply a Spring Security annotation. The preceding example shows that CrudRepository has four delete methods, and you must override all delete methods to properly secure it. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html#security-method-level-security"
"How can I enable method-level security in Spring Data REST?","To enable method-level security in Spring Data REST, you need to use Spring Security's @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity annotation. The following example shows how to configure method-level security in Spring Data REST: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html#security-method-level-security"

"What happens when you click on a NON-GET button with a + or a > sign on it in the HAL Explorer?","When you click on a NON-GET button with a + or a > sign on it in the HAL Explorer, a modal dialog appears. It shows the HTTP method belonging to the clicked button. You can fill the body and submit the new JSON document. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html})"
"How can you customize the URI for item resources in Spring Data REST?","In Spring Data REST, you can customize the URI for item resources by using the configuration API on RepositoryRestConfiguration or by registering an implementation of EntityLookup as a Spring bean in your application. This allows Spring Data REST to tweak the URI generation according to the implementation. You can also register mapping methods as method references to tweak the URI creation. For older Java versions, you should implement a UserEntityLookup that resembles the following: @Component public class UserEntityLookup extends EntityLookupSupport<User> { private final UserRepository repository; public UserEntityLookup(UserRepository repository) { this.repository = repository; } @Override public Serializable getResourceIdentifier(User entity) { return entity.getUsername(); } @Override public Object lookupEntity(Serializable id) { return repository.findByUsername(id.toString()); } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing-sdr.html)"
"How can you customize the HTTP methods supported by Spring Data REST?","To customize the HTTP methods supported by Spring Data REST, you can use RepositoryRestConfiguration.getExposureConfiguration(). The class exposes a Lambda-based API to define both global and type-based rules. For example, you can disable the support for HTTP PUT to create item resources directly with config.forDomainType(User.class).disablePutForCreation(). You can also disable the support for HTTP PATCH on all item resources with config.withItemExposure((metadata, httpMethods) -> httpMethods.disable(HttpMethod.PATCH)). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing-sdr.html)"
"How can you customize the repository exposure in Spring Data REST?","In Spring Data REST, you can customize the repository exposure by explicitly setting a RepositoryDetectionStrategy (usually through the enum RepositoryDetectionStrategies) on RepositoryRestConfiguration. The following values can be configured: ALL, DEFAULT, VISIBILITY, and ANNOTATED. If you need custom rules to apply, you can implement RepositoryDetectionStrategy manually. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing-sdr.html)"
"How can I add custom links to the JSON output of a Spring Data REST application?","You can add custom links to the JSON output of a Spring Data REST application by implementing the RepresentationModelProcessor interface and adding a link to an EntityModel in the process method.

"What is the purpose of the RepresentationModelProcessor interface in Spring Data REST?","The RepresentationModelProcessor interface is used to alter the representation of resources that go out to the client in Spring Data REST. It allows you to customize the JSON output of your application. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>)"
"How can I completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in a Spring Data REST application?","To completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in a Spring Data REST application, you can register your own ConversionService in the ApplicationContext and register your own Converter<Entity, EntityModel> to return a EntityModel implementation of your choosing. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>)"
"What is the purpose of custom serializers and deserializers in Spring Data REST?","Custom serializers and deserializers in Spring Data REST are used to handle domain models that do not easily translate to JSON. They provide a way to configure Jackson's ObjectMapper with custom type mappings and (de)serializers to accommodate use cases where the default configuration may not handle the domain model correctly."
"How can you register a type mapping for an abstract class or interface in Spring Data REST?","To register a type mapping for an abstract class or interface in Spring Data REST, you can create a Module bean and, in the setupModule method, add an appropriate TypeResolver. This can be done by using the SimpleAbstractTypeResolver and adding a mapping for the abstract class or interface."
"How do you add custom serializers and deserializers for domain types in Spring Data REST?","To add custom serializers and deserializers for domain types in Spring Data REST, you can register your own implementations with Jackson's ObjectMapper. This can be done by creating a Module bean and, in the setupModule method, adding the serializers and deserializers using SimpleSerializers and SimpleDeserializers."

It can be used to conditionally PUT, PATCH, or DELETE a resource if a If-Match header is supplied. If the resource's current ETag state matches the If-Match header, the operation is carried out. This safeguard prevents clients from stomping on each other. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"What is the difference between the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers in Spring Data REST?","The If-None-Match header allows conditional queries, while the If-Modified-Since header provides a way to check whether a resource has been updated since the last request. The If-None-Match header lets applications avoid resending the same data, while the If-Modified-Since header avoids fetching the same data twice when it has not been updated. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"How can you architect a more efficient front end using ETag elements and Last-Modified values in Spring Data REST?","To architect a more efficient front end, you can identify the entities that need locking and add a version attribute. Identify the entries that would benefit from tracking the most recent updates and store the Last-Modified value in the DOM. When fetching resources, also embed self URIs in your DOM nodes. Adjust PUT/PATCH/DELETE operations to use If-Match and handle HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status codes. Adjust GET operations to use If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since and handle HTTP 304 Not Modified status codes. By embedding ETag elements and Last-Modified values in your DOM, you can reduce the consumption of data and battery power by not retrieving the same thing over and over. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"How can you register a Validator instance in Spring Data REST?","You can register a Validator instance in Spring Data REST by either wiring it by bean name or registering the validator manually. For the majority of cases, the simple bean name prefix style is sufficient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/validation.html)"
"How do you tell Spring Data REST to assign a particular Validator to a specific event?","To tell Spring Data REST you want a particular Validator assigned to a particular event, prefix the bean name with the event in question. For example, to validate instances of the Person class before new ones are saved into the repository, you would declare an instance of a Validator<Person> in your ApplicationContext with a bean name of beforeCreatePersonValidator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/validation.html)"
"How can you assign Validators manually in Spring Data REST?","If you would rather not use the bean name prefix approach, you need to register an instance of your validator with the bean whose job it is to invoke validators after the correct event. In your configuration that implements RepositoryRestConfigurer, override the configureValidatingRepositoryEventListener method and call addValidator on the ValidatingRepositoryEventListener, passing the event on which you want this validator to be triggered and an instance of the validator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/validation.html)"
"What are the eight different events emitted by the REST exporter in Spring Data REST?","The REST exporter emits eight different events: BeforeCreateEvent, AfterCreateEvent, BeforeSaveEvent, AfterSaveEvent, BeforeLinkSaveEvent, AfterLinkSaveEvent, BeforeDeleteEvent, and AfterDeleteEvent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you write an ApplicationListener to handle these events in Spring Data REST?","To write an ApplicationListener, subclass the AbstractRepositoryEventListener and override the methods for the events in question. This approach makes no distinction based on the type of the entity, so you have to inspect that yourself. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you write an annotated handler to filter events based on domain type in Spring Data REST?","To write an annotated handler, create a POJO and put the @RepositoryEventHandler annotation on it. This tells the BeanPostProcessor to inspect the class for handler methods. Once the BeanPostProcessor finds a bean with this annotation, it iterates over the exposed methods and looks for annotations that correspond to the event in question. The domain type whose events you are interested in is determined from the type of the first parameter of the annotated methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ALPS draft spec and how does it relate to Spring Data REST?","The ALPS draft spec is meant to define a particular profile format, which is used by Spring Data REST to provide detailed metadata about the application's semantics and the attributes of each repository. This increased reusability of profile documents across media types allows clients to deduce not only the available RESTful transitions but also, to some degree, the data elements needed to interact with the back end. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"What is the difference between the media types of application/alps+json and application/hal+json?","The media type of application/alps+json is used for the ALPS format, which is a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics. On the other hand, the media type of application/hal+json is used for the HAL format, which is a hypermedia-driven RESTful API style. These two formats are different and governed by different specifications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"How can you add custom messages to your ALPS metadata in a Spring Data REST application?","To add custom messages to your ALPS metadata in a Spring Data REST application, you can create a rest-messages.properties file and define rest.description.* properties to display details for a specific resource. These properties alter the ALPS format of the resource representation by adding an extra doc attribute to each field. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"How can you secure Spring Data REST services with method-level security using Spring Security?","You can secure Spring Data REST services with method-level security using Spring Security by applying the @PreAuthorize annotation to the methods in the repository. The @PreAuthorize annotation allows you to specify a Spring Security SpEL expression that checks the user's roles before executing the method. For example, to secure the entire repository, you can apply the @PreAuthorize annotation to the repository interface, and to change method-level settings, you must override the method signature and apply the @PreAuthorize annotation. The method-level settings override the repository-level settings. To enable method-level security, you need to use the @EnableMethodSecurity annotation in your Spring configuration class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html)"
"What is the difference between the @PreAuthorize annotation and the @Secured annotation in Spring Security?","The @PreAuthorize annotation is more flexible than the @Secured annotation in Spring Security. The @PreAuthorize annotation allows you to specify a Spring Security SpEL expression that checks the user's roles, permissions, or any other expression. The @Secured annotation, on the other hand, is purely role-based and allows only roles as the means to restrict access. If you are starting with a new project or first applying Spring Security, the @PreAuthorize annotation is recommended. If you are already using Spring Security with @Secured in other parts of your app, you can continue on that path without rewriting everything. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html)"
"How can you configure method-level security in Spring Data REST using Spring Security?","To configure method-level security in Spring Data REST using Spring Security, you need to use the @EnableMethodSecurity annotation in your Spring configuration class. The @EnableMethodSecurity annotation enables both @Secured and @Pre/@Post support. You can use the securedEnabled and prePostEnabled attributes to enable or disable the respective security features. For example, to enable both @Secured and @Pre/@Post support, you can use the following annotation: @EnableMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true, prePostEnabled = true). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html)"
"What is the HAL Explorer and who created it?","The HAL Explorer is a useful application created by Kai Tödter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html)"
"How can I add the HAL Explorer dependency in Maven?","You can add the HAL Explorer dependency in Maven by using the following code: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId> <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-explorer</artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html)"
"What happens when you click on a NON-GET button with a + or a > sign on it in the HAL Explorer?","When you click on a NON-GET button with a + or a > sign on it in the HAL Explorer, a modal dialog appears. It shows the HTTP method belonging to the clicked button. You can fill the body and submit the new JSON document. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html)"
"What annotation should be used to create a custom handler for a specific resource in Spring Data REST?","@RepositoryRestController (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/overriding-sdr-response-handlers.html>)"
"How can I override the default response handlers in Spring Data REST?","You can override the default response handlers by using the @RepositoryRestController annotation instead of a standard Spring MVC @Controller or @RestController. This allows you to take advantage of Spring Data REST's settings, message converters, exception handling, and more. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/overriding-sdr-response-handlers.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the AggregateReference class in Spring Data REST?","The AggregateReference class is used to capture references to other resources in custom controllers receiving PUT and POST requests. It can resolve these references into either the referenced aggregate's identifier, the aggregate itself, or a jMolecules Association. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/overriding-sdr-response-handlers.html>)"
"How can I add links to the default representation of an entity in Spring Data REST?","You can add links to the default representation of an entity in Spring Data REST by calling model.add(Link) as shown in the example. Any links you add to the EntityModel are added to the final output. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>) "
"What is the purpose of the RepresentationModelProcessor interface in Spring Data REST?","The RepresentationModelProcessor interface is used to process entities and alter the representation of resources that go out to the client. All beans of type RepresentationModelProcessor<EntityModel<T>> are automatically picked up by the Spring Data REST exporter and triggered when serializing an entity of type T. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>) "
"How can I completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in Spring Data REST?","To completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in Spring Data REST, you can register your own ConversionService in the ApplicationContext and register your own Converter<Entity, EntityModel>. You can then return a EntityModel implementation of your choosing. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>) "
"How can I handle complex domain models that do not easily translate to JSON using Spring Data REST?","You can configure Jackson's ObjectMapper with your own custom type mappings and (de)serializers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/custom-jackson-deserialization.html)"
"What is the purpose of the setupModule method in a custom Jackson Module bean for Spring Data REST?","The setupModule method allows you to configure Jackson's JSON mapping and perform various customizations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/custom-jackson-deserialization.html)"
"How can I register custom serializers and deserializers for domain types in Spring Data REST?","You can add serializers and deserializers from your setupModule method implementation by adding them to the SimpleSerializers and SimpleDeserializers objects and then adding them to the context. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/custom-jackson-deserialization.html)"
"What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Spring Data REST?","The purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Spring Data REST is to enable specific HTTP resources to be accessible when working with client-side HTTP requests issued by a browser. This is important because browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources residing outside the current origin for security reasons. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/configuring-cors.html)"
"How can you enable CORS for a whole repository in Spring Data REST?","You can enable CORS for a whole repository in Spring Data REST by adding a @CrossOrigin annotation to your repository interfaces. By default, @CrossOrigin allows all origins and HTTP methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/configuring-cors.html)"
"How can you add global CORS configuration in Spring Data REST?","You can add global CORS configuration in Spring Data REST by implementing the RepositoryRestConfigurer interface and overriding the configureRepositoryRestConfiguration method. This method takes a RepositoryRestConfiguration and a CorsRegistry as parameters, allowing you to configure CORS settings such as allowed origins, methods, and headers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/configuring-cors.html)"
