The following code shows a typical @RestController that serves JSON data. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/servlet.html#web.servlet.spring-mvc.controller)"
"What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController in Spring MVC?","@Controller is used to handle HTTP requests and return view names, while @RestController is used to handle HTTP requests and return data directly as a response. The difference is that @RestController automatically adds the @ResponseBody annotation to its methods, which means that the method return value is directly serialized and sent as the response body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/servlet.html#web.servlet.spring-mvc.controller)"
"How can you customize the error handling behavior in Spring Boot?","In Spring Boot, you can customize the default error handling behavior by implementing ErrorController and registering a bean definition of that type or adding a bean of type ErrorAttributes to use the existing mechanism but replace the contents. The BasicErrorController can be used as a base class for a custom ErrorController. This is particularly useful if you want to add a handler for a new content type. To do so, extend BasicErrorController, add a public method with a @RequestMapping that has a produces attribute, and create a bean of your new type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/servlet.html#web.servlet.spring-mvc.error-handling)"
"What is the main difference between Spring WebFlux and Spring MVC?","Spring WebFlux is a new reactive web framework introduced in Spring Framework 5.0, while Spring MVC is a traditional servlet-based web framework.

You can use the webEnvironment attribute of @SpringBootTest to further refine how your tests run: MOCK (Default) : Loads a web ApplicationContext and provides a mock web environment. Embedded servers are not started when using this annotation. If a web environment is not available on your classpath, this mode transparently falls back to creating a regular non-web ApplicationContext . It can be used in conjunction with @AutoConfigureMockMvc or @AutoConfigureWebTestClient(#testing.spring-boot-applications.with-mock-environment) for mock-based testing of your web application. RANDOM_PORT : Loads a WebServerApplicationContext and provides a real web environment. Embedded servers are started and listen on a random port. DEFINED_PORT : Loads a WebServerApplicationContext and provides a real web environment. Embedded servers are started and listen on a defined port (from your application.properties ) or on the default port of 8080 . NONE : Loads an ApplicationContext by using SpringApplication but does not provide any web environment (mock or otherwise).

"How can I change the HTTP port or address of the Actuator endpoints in a standalone Spring Boot application?","You can change the HTTP port or address of the Actuator endpoints in a standalone Spring Boot application by setting the external property 'management.server.port' to the desired port and 'management.server.address' to the desired IP address. This allows the application to listen on a different port or network address. For more details, refer to the ManagementServerProperties source code and Customizing the Management Server Port in the 'Production-Ready Features' section."
"How can I customize the 'whitelabel' error page in a Spring Boot application?","To customize the 'whitelabel' error page in a Spring Boot application, you can set 'server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false' to switch the default error page off. This restores the default of the servlet container you are using. However, Spring Boot still tries to resolve the error view, so you should probably add your own error page rather than disabling it completely. Overriding the error page with your own depends on the templating technology you use. For example, if you use Thymeleaf, you can add an error.html template. If you use FreeMarker, you can add an error.ftlh template. In general, you need a View that resolves with a name of error or a @Controller that handles the /error path. See ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration for more options."
"How can I customize the sanitization of property sources in a Spring Boot application?","To customize the sanitization of property sources in a Spring Boot application, you can define a SanitizingFunction bean. The SanitizableData with which the function is called provides access to the key and value as well as the PropertySource from which they came. This allows you to sanitize every value that comes from a particular property source. Each SanitizingFunction is called in order until a function changes the value of the sanitizable data."
"How can I switch off the default webapp security settings in Spring Boot?","If you define a @Configuration with a SecurityFilterChain bean in your application, this action switches off the default webapp security settings in Spring Boot.

"How can I hot reload static content in Spring Boot?","To hot reload static content in Spring Boot, you can use the spring-boot-devtools module, which monitors the classpath for changes. This means that static resource changes must be ""built"" for the change to take effect. By default, this happens automatically in Eclipse when you save your changes. In IntelliJ IDEA, the Make Project command triggers the necessary build. Due to the default restart exclusions, changes to static resources do not trigger a restart of your application. They do, however, trigger a live reload."
"How can I reload templates without restarting the container in Spring Boot?","To reload templates without restarting the container in Spring Boot, you can disable caching for the templating technology you are using. Most of the templating technologies supported by Spring Boot include a configuration option to disable caching.

"How can a Spring Boot application be installed as a systemd service?","To install a Spring Boot application as a systemd service, create a script named myapp.service and place it in the /etc/systemd/system directory. The following script offers an example: [Unit] Description=myapp After=syslog.target network.target [Service] User=myapp Group=myapp Environment=""JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/home"" ExecStart=${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -jar /var/myapp/myapp.jar ExecStop=/bin/kill -15 $MAINPID SuccessExitStatus=143 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Remember to change the Description, User, Group, Environment, and ExecStart fields for your application. The ExecStart field does not declare the script action command, which means that the run command is used by default. The user that runs the application, the PID file, and the console log file are managed by systemd itself and therefore must be configured by using appropriate fields in the ‘service’ script. Consult the service unit configuration man page (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) for more details. To flag the application to start automatically on system boot, use the following command: $ systemctl enable myapp.service Run man systemctl for more details.

For example, on a Debian-based system, you could start it with the following command: $ service myapp start If your application fails to start, check the log file written to /var/log/<appname>.log for errors. You can also flag the application to start automatically by using your standard operating system tools. For example, on Debian, you could use the following command: $ update-rc.d myapp defaults <priority> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/deployment/installing.html)"
"How can the default embedded startup script written by the Maven or Gradle plugin be customized?","The default embedded startup script written by the Maven or Gradle plugin can be customized in a number of ways. For most people, using the default script along with a few customizations is usually enough. If you find you cannot customize something that you need to, use the embeddedLaunchScript option to write your own file entirely. Customizing the Start Script When It Is Written: It often makes sense to customize elements of the start script as it is written into the jar file. For example, init.d scripts can provide a “description”. Since you know the description up front (and it need not change), you may as well provide it when the jar is generated. To customize written elements, use the embeddedLaunchScriptProperties option of the Spring Boot Maven plugin or the properties property of the Spring Boot Gradle plugin’s launchScript(../../gradle-plugin/packaging.html#packaging-executable.configuring.launch-script) . The following property substitutions are supported with the default script: Name Description Gradle default Maven default mode The script mode. auto auto initInfoProvides The Provides section of “INIT INFO”. ${task.baseName} ${project.artifactId} initInfoRequiredStart Required-Start section of “INIT INFO”. $remote_fs $syslog $network $remote_fs $syslog $network initInfoRequiredStop Required-Stop section of “INIT INFO”. $remote_fs $syslog $network $remote_fs $syslog $network initInfoDefaultStart Default-Start section of “INIT INFO”. 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 initInfoDefaultStop Default-Stop section of “INIT INFO”. 0 1 6 0 1 6 initInfoShortDescription Short-Description section of “INIT INFO”. Single-line version of ${project.description} (falling back to ${task.baseName} ) ${project.name} initInfoDescription Description section of “INIT INFO”. ${project.description} (falling back to ${task.baseName} ) ${project.description} (falling back to ${project.name} ) initInfoChkconfig chkconfig section of “INIT INFO” 2345 99 01 2345 99 01 confFolder The default value for CONF_FOLDER Folder containing the jar Folder containing the jar inlinedConfScript Reference to a file script that should be inlined in the default launch script. This can be used to set environmental variables such as JAVA_OPTS before any external config files are loaded logFolder Default value for LOG_FOLDER . Only valid for an init.d service logFilename Default value for LOG_FILENAME . Only valid for an init.d service pidFolder Default value for PID_FOLDER . Only valid for an init.d service pidFilename Default value for the name of the PID file in PID_FOLDER . Only valid for an init.d service useStartStopDaemon Whether the start-stop-daemon command, when it is available, should be used to control the process true true stopWaitTime Default value for STOP_WAIT_TIME in seconds. Only valid for an init.d service 60 60 Customizing a Script When It Runs: For items of the script that need to be customized after the jar has been written, you can use environment variables or a config file(#howto.deployment.installing.init-d.script-customization.when-running.conf-file) . The following environment properties are supported with the default script: Variable Description MODE The “mode” of operation. The default depends on the way the jar was built but is usually auto (meaning it tries to guess if it is an init script by checking if it is a symlink in a directory called init.d ). You can explicitly set it to service so that the stop|start|status|restart commands work or to run if you want to run the script in the foreground. RUN_AS_USER The user that will be used to run the application. When not set, the user that owns the jar file will be used. USE_START_STOP_DAEMON Whether the start-stop-daemon command, when it is available, should be used to control the process. Defaults to true . PID_FOLDER The root name of the pid folder ( /var/run by default). LOG_FOLDER The name of the folder in which to put log files ( /var/log by default). CONF_FOLDER The name of the folder from which to read .conf files (same folder as jar-file by default). LOG_FILENAME The name of the log file in the LOG_FOLDER ( <appname>.log by default). APP_NAME The name of the app. If the jar is run from a symlink, the script guesses the app name. If it is not a symlink or you want to explicitly set the app name, this can be useful. RUN_ARGS The arguments to pass to the program (the Spring Boot app). JAVA_HOME The location of the java executable is discovered by using the PATH by default, but you can set it explicitly if there is an executable file at $JAVA_HOME/bin/java . JAVA_OPTS Options that are passed to the JVM when it is launched. JARFILE The explicit location of the jar file, in case the script is being used to launch a jar that it is not actually embedded. DEBUG If not empty, sets the -x flag on the shell process, allowing you to see the logic in the script. STOP_WAIT_TIME The time in seconds to wait when stopping the application before forcing a shutdown ( 60 by default). The PID_FOLDER , LOG_FOLDER , and LOG_FILENAME variables are only valid for an init.d service. For systemd , the equivalent customizations are made by using the ‘service’ script. See the service unit configuration man page(https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) for more details. Using a Conf File: With the exception of JARFILE and APP_NAME , the settings listed in the preceding section can be configured by using a .conf file. The file is expected to be next to the jar file and have the same name but suffixed with .conf rather than .jar . For example, a jar named /var/myapp/myapp.jar uses the configuration file named /var/myapp/myapp.conf , as shown in the following example: myapp.conf JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx1024M LOG_FOLDER=/custom/log/folder If you do not like having the config file next to the jar file, you can set a CONF_FOLDER environment variable to customize the location of the config file. To learn about securing this file appropriately, see the guidelines for securing an init.d service(#howto.deployment.installing.init-d.securing) .

"How can I share services between multiple applications using Docker Compose in Spring Boot?","To share services between multiple applications, create the compose.yaml file in one of the applications and then use the configuration property spring.docker.compose.file in the other applications to reference the compose.yaml file. You should also set spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management to start-only, as it defaults to start-and-stop and stopping one application would shut down the shared services for the other still running applications as well. Setting it to start-only won’t stop the shared services on application stop, but a caveat is that if you shut down all applications, the services remain running. You can stop the services manually by running docker compose stop on the command line in the directory which contains the compose.yaml file. Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/docker-compose.html"
"What is the default value for spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management and how can I change it?","The default value for spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management is start-and-stop.

The Spring Framework is divided into modules, and applications can choose which modules they need. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/overview.html)"
"What is the core technology of the Spring Framework?","The core technology of the Spring Framework is its Inversion of Control (IoC) container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's AOP framework?","Spring's AOP framework is designed to address the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming. It is conceptually easy to understand and serves as an alternative to AspectJ, which is currently the richest and most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core.html)"
"What is AOT processing and how is it used in the Spring Framework?","AOT (Ahead-of-Time) processing is a technique used to optimize applications ahead of deployment. In the context of the Spring Framework, it is typically used for native image deployment using GraalVM. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container?","The Spring IoC container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of objects, providing dependencies to them, and controlling their scope. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html#beans-overview)"
"What is a bean in the context of Spring's IoC container?","A bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC container. It can be created, configured, and managed by the container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html#beans-definition)"
"How can you define dependencies for a bean in Spring?","Dependencies for a bean can be defined using constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html#beans-definition-dependencies)"
"What is the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle and how does it relate to Dependency Injection (DI) in the context of Spring Framework?","The Inversion of Control (IoC) principle is a design principle in which an object's dependencies are injected rather than constructed or located by the object itself. Dependency Injection (DI) is a specialized form of IoC where objects define their dependencies through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties set after construction or return from a factory method. In Spring Framework, the IoC container injects these dependencies when it creates the bean, which is fundamentally the inverse of the bean controlling its own dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html)"
"What is the difference between the BeanFactory and ApplicationContext interfaces in Spring Framework?","The BeanFactory interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object. The ApplicationContext is a sub-interface of BeanFactory that adds additional enterprise-specific functionality, such as easier integration with Spring's AOP features, message resource handling for internationalization, event publication, and application-layer specific contexts like the WebApplicationContext for web applications. The ApplicationContext is a complete superset of the BeanFactory and is used exclusively in descriptions of Spring's IoC container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html)"
"What are beans in the context of Spring Framework and how are they managed by the Spring IoC container?","Beans in Spring Framework are objects that are instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. They form the backbone of your application and their dependencies are reflected in the configuration metadata used by the container. In other words, beans are simply one of many objects in your application, but they are managed by the Spring IoC container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface in Spring IoC container?","The org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html)"
"What are the different formats for configuration metadata in Spring?","The configuration metadata in Spring can be represented as annotated component classes, configuration classes with factory methods, or external XML files or Groovy scripts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html)"
"How can you retrieve instances of beans in the Spring ApplicationContext?","You can retrieve instances of your beans using the method T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType) in the ApplicationContext. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/basics.html)"
"What is the purpose of a Spring IoC container and how does it manage beans?","A Spring IoC container manages one or more beans. These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container. Within the container itself, these bean definitions are represented as BeanDefinition objects, which contain the following metadata: a package-qualified class name, bean behavioral configuration elements, references to other beans, and other configuration settings. Beans are created with the configuration metadata encapsulated by that bean definition. The container looks at the recipe for a named bean when asked and uses the configuration metadata to create (or acquire) an actual object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'id' and 'name' attributes in XML-based configuration metadata?","The 'id' attribute lets you specify exactly one id for a bean. Conventionally, these names are alphanumeric, but they can contain special characters as well. The 'name' attribute can be used to specify aliases for the bean. If you want to introduce other aliases for the bean, you can also specify them in the name attribute, separated by a comma, semicolon, or white space. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'class' attribute in XML-based configuration metadata?","The 'class' attribute is used to specify the type (or class) of object that is to be instantiated in the <bean/> element. This attribute is usually mandatory. It can be used to specify the bean class to be constructed in the case where the container itself directly creates the bean by calling its constructor reflectively, or to specify the actual class containing the static factory method that is invoked to create the object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/definition.html)"
"What is the purpose of dependency injection in Spring Boot?","Dependency injection in Spring Boot is a technique used to collaborate objects and achieve a goal. It allows for the creation of a fully realized application where objects work together to present a cohesive application to the end-user. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies.html)"
"What is the difference between a bean definition and a fully realized application in the context of Spring Boot?","A bean definition in Spring Boot is a standalone object that is defined within the context of the application. A fully realized application, on the other hand, is the result of multiple beans working together to achieve a goal and present a cohesive application to the end-user. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies.html)"
"What is the purpose of the depends-on attribute in Spring Boot?","The depends-on attribute in Spring Boot is used to specify a dependency between beans. This allows for the order of bean instantiation to be controlled, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are initialized before the dependent bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies.html)"
"What is Dependency Injection (DI) and how does it work?","Dependency Injection (DI) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies on its own. Code is cleaner with the DI principle, and decoupling is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. DI exists in two major variants: Constructor-based dependency injection and Setter-based dependency injection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html)"
"What is the difference between Constructor-based Dependency Injection and Setter-based Dependency Injection?","Constructor-based DI is accomplished by the container invoking a constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency. Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or a no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean. It is a good rule of thumb to use constructors for mandatory dependencies and setter methods or configuration methods for optional dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html)"
"What is the Dependency Resolution Process in Spring?","The container performs bean dependency resolution by creating and initializing the ApplicationContext with configuration metadata that describes all the beans. For each bean, its dependencies are expressed in the form of properties, constructor arguments, or arguments to the static-factory method. These dependencies are provided to the bean when the bean is actually created. Each property or constructor argument is an actual definition of the value to set, or a reference to another bean in the container. Each property or constructor argument that is a value is converted from its specified format to the actual type of that property or constructor argument. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-collaborators.html)"
"How can you define bean properties and constructor arguments as references to other managed beans (collaborators) or as values defined inline in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata?","You can define bean properties and constructor arguments as references to other managed beans (collaborators) or as values defined inline in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata by using the <property/> and <constructor-arg/> elements. These elements support sub-element types for this purpose, such as the value attribute of the <property/> element, which specifies a property or constructor argument as a human-readable string representation. Spring's conversion service is used to convert these values from a String to the actual type of the property or argument. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-properties-detailed.html>)"
"What is the difference between using the idref element and the value attribute when passing the id of another bean in the container to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element?","The difference between using the idref element and the value attribute when passing the id of another bean in the container to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element is that using the idref tag lets the container validate at deployment time that the referenced, named bean actually exists. In contrast, using the value attribute does not provide this validation, and typos are only discovered at runtime when the client bean is instantiated. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-properties-detailed.html>)"
"How can you define an inner bean within a <property/> or <constructor-arg/> element in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata?","You can define an inner bean within a <property/> or <constructor-arg/> element in Spring's XML-based configuration metadata by placing a <bean/> element inside the <property/> or <constructor-arg/> elements. An inner bean definition does not require a defined ID or name, and it is always created with the outer bean. It is not possible to access inner beans independently or to inject them into collaborating beans other than into the enclosing bean. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-properties-detailed.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the depends-on attribute in Spring Beans?","The depends-on attribute can explicitly force one or more beans to be initialized before the bean using this element is initialized. It can also control shutdown order by ensuring dependent beans are destroyed first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-dependson.html)"
"How can you express a dependency on multiple beans using the depends-on attribute?","To express a dependency on multiple beans, supply a list of bean names as the value of the depends-on attribute (commas, whitespace, and semicolons are valid delimiters). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-dependson.html)"
"Can the depends-on attribute control shutdown order in Spring Beans?","Yes, the depends-on attribute can also control shutdown order by ensuring dependent beans are destroyed first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-dependson.html)"
"What is lazy-initialization in the context of Spring Boot?","Lazy-initialization in Spring Boot refers to the process of creating a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup. This is controlled by the lazy-init attribute on the <bean/> element in XML configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-lazy-init.html)"
"How can you prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean in Spring Boot?","You can prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as being lazy-initialized. This can be done by setting the lazy-init attribute on the <bean/> element to true. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-lazy-init.html)"
"Can you control lazy-initialization at the container level in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the default-lazy-init attribute on the <beans/> element. Setting this attribute to true will prevent all beans from being pre-instantiated when the ApplicationContext starts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-lazy-init.html)"
"What is the default autowiring mode in Spring?","The default autowiring mode in Spring is 'no'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html)"
"How does autowiring by type work in Spring?","Autowiring by type in Spring lets a property be autowired if exactly one bean of the property type exists in the container. If more than one exists, a fatal exception is thrown. If there are no matching beans, nothing happens. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html)"
"Can you autowire simple properties in Spring?","No, you cannot autowire simple properties such as primitives, Strings, and Classes (and arrays of such simple properties) in Spring. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html)"
"What is the main problem when a singleton bean needs to use a non-singleton (prototype) bean in Spring Boot?","The container creates the singleton bean only once, and thus only gets one opportunity to set the properties. The container cannot provide bean A with a new instance of bean B every time one is needed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.html)"
"How can the problem of different bean lifecycles be solved in Spring Boot?","Bean A can be made aware of the container by implementing the ApplicationContextAware interface, and by making a getBean('B') call to the container to ask for a new bean B instance every time bean A needs it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.html)"
"What is Method Injection in the Spring IoC container?","Method Injection is a feature of the Spring IoC container that lets you handle the use case of a bean needing a new instance of another bean on each method invocation, cleanly. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/dependencies/factory-method-injection.html)"
"What is the default scope for beans in Spring?","The default scope for beans in Spring is singleton. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-singleton)"
"How does the prototype scope differ from the singleton scope in Spring?","The prototype scope results in the creation of a new bean instance every time a request for that specific bean is made, while the singleton scope creates exactly one instance of the object defined by that bean definition. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-prototype)"
"What is the purpose of using a custom scope in Spring?","A custom scope allows you to define your own scopes or even redefine existing scopes, although the latter is considered bad practice and you cannot override the built-in singleton and prototype scopes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-custom)"
"What are the three options for controlling bean lifecycle behavior in Spring 2.5?","The InitializingBean and DisposableBean callback interfaces, Custom init() and destroy() methods, and The @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-nature.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Lifecycle interface in Spring?","The Lifecycle interface defines the essential methods for any object that has its own lifecycle requirements (such as starting and stopping some background process). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-nature.html)"
"What is the difference between the org.springframework.context.Lifecycle interface and the org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle interface?","The org.springframework.context.Lifecycle interface is a plain contract for explicit start and stop notifications and does not imply auto-startup at context refresh time. The org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle interface, on the other hand, provides fine-grained control over auto-startup and for graceful stopping of a specific bean, including startup and stop phases. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-nature.html)"
"What is Bean Definition Inheritance in Spring Boot?","Bean Definition Inheritance is a feature in Spring Boot that allows a child bean definition to inherit configuration data from a parent bean definition. This can save a lot of typing and is a form of templating. Child bean definitions are represented by the ChildBeanDefinition class, and they can override some values or add others as needed. Most users configure bean definitions declaratively in a class such as the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext. When using XML-based configuration metadata, you can indicate a child bean definition by using the parent attribute, specifying the parent bean as the value of this attribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/child-bean-definitions.html)"
"How can I indicate a child bean definition in XML-based configuration metadata?","To indicate a child bean definition in XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the parent attribute and specify the parent bean as the value of this attribute. The following example shows how to do so: <bean id=""inheritedTestBean"" abstract=""true"" class=""org.springframework.beans.TestBean""> <property name=""name"" value=""parent""/> <property name=""age"" value=""1""/> </bean> <bean id=""inheritsWithDifferentClass"" class=""org.springframework.beans.DerivedTestBean"" parent=""inheritedTestBean"" init-method=""initialize""> <property name=""name"" value=""override""/> <!-- the age property value of 1 will be inherited from parent --> </bean> Note the parent attribute. A child bean definition uses the bean class from the parent definition if none is specified but can also override it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/child-bean-definitions.html)"
"What are the settings that a child bean definition inherits from the parent?","A child bean definition inherits scope, constructor argument values, property values, and method overrides from the parent, with the option to add new values. Any scope, initialization method, destroy method, or static factory method settings that you specify override the corresponding parent settings. The remaining settings are always taken from the child definition: depends on, autowire mode, dependency check, singleton, and lazy init. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/child-bean-definitions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the BeanPostProcessor interface in Spring IoC container?","The BeanPostProcessor interface defines callback methods that you can implement to provide your own (or override the container’s default) instantiation logic, dependency resolution logic, and so forth. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-extension.html)"
"How can you control the order in which BeanPostProcessor instances run?","You can control the order in which BeanPostProcessor instances run by setting the order property. However, you can only set this property if the BeanPostProcessor implements the Ordered interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-extension.html)"
"What is the difference between BeanPostProcessor and BeanFactoryPostProcessor?","BeanPostProcessor operates on bean (or object) instances, while BeanFactoryPostProcessor operates on the bean configuration metadata. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-extension.html)"
"What is Annotation-based Container Configuration in Spring?","Annotation-based Container Configuration in Spring is a method that provides comprehensive support for configuration using annotations on the relevant class, method, or field declaration. It operates on metadata in the component class itself and uses BeanPostProcessors in conjunction with annotations to make the core IOC container aware of specific annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config.html)"
"What are some examples of annotations supported by Spring for annotation-based configuration?","@Autowired, @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy, @Inject, and @Named are examples of annotations supported by Spring for annotation-based configuration. Details about these annotations can be found in the relevant section. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config.html)"
"How is annotation-based configuration enabled in an XML-based Spring setup?","Annotation-based configuration can be enabled in an XML-based Spring setup by including the <context:annotation-config/> element in the XML configuration. This element implicitly registers several post-processors, including ConfigurationClassPostProcessor, AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, and EventListenerMethodProcessor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config.html)"
"In Spring Boot, what is the purpose of the @Autowired annotation?","The @Autowired annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into Spring-managed objects. It can be applied to constructors, setter methods, fields, and methods with arbitrary names and multiple arguments. As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on a constructor is no longer necessary if the target bean defines only one constructor. However, if several constructors are available and there is no primary/default constructor, at least one of the constructors must be annotated with @Autowired in order to instruct the container which one to use. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.html>)"
"Can I use the @Autowired annotation in place of JSR 330's @Inject annotation in Spring Boot?","Yes, JSR 330's @Inject annotation can be used in place of Spring's @Autowired annotation in Spring Boot. See the official documentation for more details. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.html>)"
"What is the difference between the required attribute in @Autowired and the non-required attribute?","The required attribute in @Autowired indicates whether the corresponding property is required for autowiring purposes. If the required attribute is set to true (default), the autowiring process will fail if no matching candidate beans are available for the injection point. If the required attribute is set to false, the framework will skip a non-satisfiable injection point, and the property will be ignored if it cannot be autowired. This allows properties to be assigned default values that can be optionally overridden via dependency injection. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @Primary annotation in Spring's autowiring?","The @Primary annotation in Spring's autowiring is used to indicate that a particular bean should be given preference when multiple beans are candidates to be autowired to a single-valued dependency. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-primary.html)"
"How can you define a primary bean in Spring's configuration?","You can define a primary bean in Spring's configuration by using the @Primary annotation on the @Bean method that creates the bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-primary.html)"
"What happens when there is exactly one primary bean among the candidates during autowiring?","When there is exactly one primary bean among the candidates during autowiring, it becomes the autowired value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-primary.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Qualifier annotation in Spring's autowiring by type?","The @Qualifier annotation is used to provide additional information to Spring's autowiring mechanism to select a specific bean among multiple candidates. It allows you to associate qualifier values with specific arguments, narrowing the set of type matches so that a specific bean is chosen for each argument. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)"
"Can you provide an example of how to use the @Qualifier annotation on individual constructor arguments or method parameters?","Yes, you can specify the @Qualifier annotation on individual constructor arguments or method parameters. Here is an example in Java:

```java
public class MovieRecommender {
    private final MovieCatalog movieCatalog;
    private final CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

    @Autowired
    public void prepare(@Qualifier(""main"") MovieCatalog movieCatalog, CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
        this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog;
        this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
    }

    // ...
}
```

And in Kotlin:

```kotlin
class MovieRecommender {
    private lateinit var movieCatalog: MovieCatalog
    private lateinit var customerPreferenceDao: CustomerPreferenceDao

    @Autowired
    fun prepare(@Qualifier(""main"") movieCatalog: MovieCatalog, customerPreferenceDao: CustomerPreferenceDao) {
        this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog
        this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao
    }

    // ...
}
```

In these examples, the @Qualifier annotation is used to specify that the `movieCatalog` argument should be autowired with the bean that has the qualifier value of ""main"". (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)"
"What is the difference between @Autowired and @Resource annotations in Spring?","The @Autowired annotation is used for type-driven injection with optional semantic qualifiers, while the @Resource annotation is semantically defined to identify a specific target component by its unique name, with the declared type being irrelevant for the matching process. @Autowired has different semantics: After selecting candidate beans by type, the specified String qualifier value is considered within those type-selected candidates only. In contrast, @Resource is supported only for fields and bean property setter methods with a single argument. As a consequence, you should stick with qualifiers if your injection target is a constructor or a multi-argument method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/autowired-qualifiers.html)"
"How can you use Java generic types as an implicit form of qualification in Spring Boot?","You can use Java generic types as an implicit form of qualification by implementing a generic interface, such as Store<String> and Store<Integer>, and then autowiring the Store interface with the generic as a qualifier. This allows you to inject specific beans based on the generic type."
"Can you autowire a generic List in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can autowire a generic List in Spring Boot. The generic type is used as a qualifier, and only beans with the matching generic type will be injected into the list. For example, if you autowire a List<Store<Integer>>, only Store beans with an <Integer> generic will be included in the list."
"How can you ensure that only specific Store beans are injected into a List in Spring Boot?","To ensure that only specific Store beans are injected into a List in Spring Boot, you can use the generic type as a qualifier when autowiring the List. For example, if you autowire a List<Store<Integer>>, only Store beans with an <Integer> generic will be included in the list."
"What is CustomAutowireConfigurer and what does it do?","CustomAutowireConfigurer is a BeanFactoryPostProcessor that allows you to register your own custom qualifier annotation types. It lets you register your custom qualifier annotations even if they are not annotated with Spring's @Qualifier annotation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/CustomAutowireConfigurer.html)"
"How can I use CustomAutowireConfigurer in my Spring application?","To use CustomAutowireConfigurer, you need to create a bean of type CustomAutowireConfigurer and set the customQualifierTypes property to a set of values representing your custom qualifier annotations. Here's an example: <bean id='customAutowireConfigurer' class='org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.CustomAutowireConfigurer'> <property name='customQualifierTypes'> <set> <value>example.CustomQualifier</value> </set> </property> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/custom-autowire-configurer.html)"
"How does the AutowireCandidateResolver determine autowire candidates?","The AutowireCandidateResolver determines autowire candidates by considering the autowire-candidate value of each bean definition, any default-autowire-candidates patterns available on the <beans/> element, the presence of @Qualifier annotations, and any custom annotations registered with the CustomAutowireConfigurer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/custom-autowire-configurer.html)"
"How can you inject a @Resource in Spring using the JSR-250 annotation?","You can inject a @Resource in Spring using the JSR-250 annotation by placing the @Resource annotation on fields or bean property setter methods. By default, Spring interprets the value of the name attribute as the bean name to be injected. If no name is explicitly specified, the default name is derived from the field name or setter method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/resource.html)"
"What is the default behavior of @Resource when no explicit name is specified?","When no explicit name is specified with the @Resource annotation, the default behavior is to derive the name from the field name or setter method. In case of a field, it takes the field name. In case of a setter method, it takes the bean property name. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/resource.html)"
"Can you explain how @Resource resolves known resolvable dependencies in Spring?","Yes, @Resource can resolve known resolvable dependencies in Spring. In the exclusive case of @Resource usage with no explicit name specified, it looks for a bean named after the field or setter method and then falls back to a primary type match for the type. It can resolve well-known resolvable dependencies such as BeanFactory, ApplicationContext, ResourceLoader, ApplicationEventPublisher, and MessageSource interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/resource.html)"
"How is the @Value annotation typically used in Spring Boot?","The @Value annotation is typically used to inject externalized properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/value-annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer bean?","The PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer bean ensures Spring initialization failure if any ${} placeholder could not be resolved. It is also possible to customize placeholders using methods like setPlaceholderPrefix, setPlaceholderSuffix, or setValueSeparator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/value-annotations.html)"
"Can you provide an example of how to use a default value with the @Value annotation?","Yes, you can provide a default value as following: @Component public class MovieRecommender { private final String catalog; public MovieRecommender(@Value(""${catalog.name:defaultCatalog}"") String catalog) { this.catalog = catalog; } }. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/value-annotations.html)"
"What are the JSR-250 lifecycle annotations supported by the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in Spring?","The JSR-250 lifecycle annotations supported by the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in Spring are: jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct and jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.html)"
"How does the support for @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations in Spring offer an alternative to the lifecycle callback mechanism described in initialization and destruction callbacks?","The support for @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations in Spring offers an alternative to the lifecycle callback mechanism described in initialization and destruction callbacks by invoking a method carrying one of these annotations at the same point in the lifecycle as the corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or explicitly declared callback method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.html)"
"What happens when the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is registered within the Spring ApplicationContext and a method carries the @PostConstruct annotation?","When the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is registered within the Spring ApplicationContext and a method carries the @PostConstruct annotation, the method is invoked upon initialization at the same point in the lifecycle as the corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or explicitly declared callback method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/annotation-config/postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of classpath scanning in Spring Boot?","Classpath scanning is used to implicitly detect candidate components by scanning the classpath. Candidate components are classes that match against a filter criteria and have a corresponding bean definition registered with the container. This removes the need to use XML to perform bean registration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/classpath-scanning.html)"
"What are stereotype annotations in Spring Boot?","Stereotype annotations are markers for classes that fulfill a specific role or stereotype in the application, such as repository, service, or controller. They can be used to customize processing by tools or associating with aspects, such as automatic exception translation in the persistence layer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/classpath-scanning.html)"
"How can you customize the classpath scanning process in Spring Boot?","You can customize the classpath scanning process by using filters to include or exclude classes based on type, expression, AspectJ type expressions, regular expressions, or custom implementations of TypeFilter. You can also disable the default filters and specify includeFilters or excludeFilters attributes of the @ComponentScan annotation or use the context:include-filter and context:exclude-filter elements in XML configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/classpath-scanning.html)"
"What are the standard annotations used for dependency injection in Spring Boot?","The standard annotations used for dependency injection in Spring Boot are JSR-330 standard annotations, specifically @Inject and @Named.

"How can I use the @Inject annotation in Spring Boot instead of @Autowired?","To use the @Inject annotation in Spring Boot instead of @Autowired, you can replace the @Autowired annotation with @jakarta.inject.Inject. You can also use @Inject at the field level, method level, and constructor-argument level. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/standard-annotations.html)"
"What is the difference between @Component and @Named or @ManagedBean in Spring Boot?","@Component is a Spring-specific annotation used to indicate that a class is a component. In contrast, @Named or @ManagedBean are JSR-330 and JSR-250 annotations, respectively, that can be used as standard equivalents to @Component. However, JSR-330 does not provide a composable model, only a way to identify named components. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/standard-annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Bean annotation in Spring Boot?","The @Bean annotation in Spring Boot is used to define a bean in a Java-based configuration class. It tells Spring to instantiate the annotated method and register it as a bean in the Spring container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java.html#beans-java-bean-annotation)"
"How can you instantiate the Spring container using annotations?","To instantiate the Spring container using annotations, you can use the AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class. You provide the class that contains the @Configuration annotation as an argument to the constructor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java.html#beans-java-instantiating-container)"
"What is the purpose of the @Configuration annotation in Spring Boot?","The @Configuration annotation in Spring Boot marks a class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring container. It allows you to define beans using annotations in your Java code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java.html#beans-java-configuration-annotation)"
"What is the purpose of the @Configuration annotation in Spring's Java configuration support?","The @Configuration annotation is used to indicate that a class's primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/basic-concepts.html)"
"What is the role of the @Bean annotation in Spring's Java configuration support?","The @Bean annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. For those familiar with Spring’s <beans/> XML configuration, the @Bean annotation plays the same role as the <bean/> element. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/basic-concepts.html)"
"What is the difference between @Bean methods declared within @Configuration classes and those declared within classes that are not annotated with @Configuration?","When @Bean methods are declared within @Configuration classes, they are processed in a full mode, ensuring that full configuration class processing applies and that cross-method references therefore get redirected to the container’s lifecycle management. When @Bean methods are declared within classes that are not annotated with @Configuration, they are referred to as being processed in a 'lite' mode, and they are effectively a general-purpose factory method mechanism without special runtime processing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/basic-concepts.html)"
"What is the purpose of the AnnotationConfigApplicationContext in Spring?","The AnnotationConfigApplicationContext is a versatile ApplicationContext implementation introduced in Spring 3.0 that is capable of accepting not only @Configuration classes as input but also plain @Component classes and classes annotated with JSR-330 metadata. It allows for completely XML-free usage of the Spring container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/instantiating-container.html)"
"How can you instantiate an AnnotationConfigApplicationContext programmatically?","You can instantiate an AnnotationConfigApplicationContext by using a no-arg constructor and then configure it by using the register() method. This approach is particularly useful when programmatically building an AnnotationConfigApplicationContext. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/instantiating-container.html)"
"What is the difference between AnnotationConfigApplicationContext and AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext?","AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext is a WebApplicationContext variant of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext that is available for configuring the Spring ContextLoaderListener servlet listener, Spring MVC DispatcherServlet, and so forth. It is used when configuring web applications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/instantiating-container.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Configuration annotation in Spring Boot?","The @Configuration annotation is a class-level annotation indicating that an object is a source of bean definitions. It declares beans through @Bean-annotated methods and can be used to define inter-bean dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/configuration-annotation.html)"
"How can you inject inter-bean dependencies in Spring Boot using Java configuration?","In Spring Boot, you can inject inter-bean dependencies by having one bean method call another within a @Configuration class. This is done through constructor injection, where the dependent bean is passed as an argument to the constructor of the dependent class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/configuration-annotation.html)"
"What is lookup method injection in Spring Boot, and when should it be used?","Lookup method injection is an advanced feature in Spring Boot that you should use rarely. It is useful in cases where a singleton-scoped bean has a dependency on a prototype-scoped bean. It allows a singleton-scoped bean to look up a new prototype-scoped bean each time it is requested. You should use lookup method injection when you need to create a new instance of a prototype-scoped bean for each request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/configuration-annotation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Import annotation in Spring's Java-based configuration feature?","The @Import annotation allows for loading @Bean definitions from another configuration class, simplifying container instantiation and reducing the complexity of your configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/composing-configuration-classes.html)"
"How can you inject dependencies on imported @Bean definitions in Spring's Java-based configuration?","You can use parameter-based injection or autowire the configuration classes themselves, but constructor injection in @Configuration classes is only supported as of Spring Framework 4.3. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/composing-configuration-classes.html)"
"How can you conditionally include @Configuration classes or @Bean methods in Spring's Java-based configuration?","You can use the @Profile annotation or other @Conditional implementations to activate beans only when a specific profile has been enabled in the Spring Environment. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/java/composing-configuration-classes.html)"
"What is the purpose of the LoadTimeWeaver in Spring?","The LoadTimeWeaver is used by Spring to dynamically transform classes as they are loaded into the Java virtual machine (JVM). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/context-load-time-weaver.html)"
"How can you enable load-time weaving in Spring?","You can add the @EnableLoadTimeWeaving annotation to one of your @Configuration classes or use the context:load-time-weaver element in XML configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/context-load-time-weaver.html)"
"What happens when a bean within an ApplicationContext implements LoadTimeWeaverAware?","The bean receives a reference to the load-time weaver instance.

You can register an ApplicationContext by using the ContextLoaderListener. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/context-introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of the MessageSource interface in Spring ApplicationContext?","The MessageSource interface in Spring ApplicationContext is used to provide internationalization (i18n) functionality. It extends the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface, which extends the BeanFactory interface, in addition to extending other interfaces to provide additional functionality in a more application framework-oriented style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/context-introduction.html)"
"What is the BeanFactory API and what is its main purpose?","The BeanFactory API provides the underlying basis for Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) functionality. Its main purpose is to manage the lifecycle of objects and provide them with the necessary dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/beanfactory.html)"
"What are the differences between the BeanFactory and ApplicationContext container levels in Spring?","The BeanFactory is a core container that provides basic bean management functionality, while the ApplicationContext extends the BeanFactory with additional features such as integrated lifecycle management, automatic BeanPostProcessor registration, and built-in ApplicationEvent publication mechanism. An ApplicationContext is generally recommended over a plain BeanFactory, except for scenarios where full control over bean processing is needed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/beanfactory.html)"
"How can you register a BeanPostProcessor with a DefaultListableBeanFactory?","To register a BeanPostProcessor with a DefaultListableBeanFactory, you need to programmatically call the addBeanPostProcessor method. The following example shows how to do this in Java and Kotlin: Java: DefaultListableBeanFactory factory = new DefaultListableBeanFactory(); // populate the factory with bean definitions // now register any needed BeanPostProcessor instances factory.addBeanPostProcessor(new AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor()); factory.addBeanPostProcessor(new MyBeanPostProcessor()); // now start using the factory Kotlin: val factory = DefaultListableBeanFactory() // populate the factory with bean definitions // now register any needed BeanPostProcessor instances factory.addBeanPostProcessor(AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor()) factory.addBeanPostProcessor(MyBeanPostProcessor()) // now start using the factory (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/beanfactory.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's Resource interface?","Spring's Resource interface located in the org.springframework.core.io. package is meant to be a more capable interface for abstracting access to low-level resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/resources.html)"
"What are some built-in Resource implementations in Spring?","Spring includes several built-in Resource implementations such as UrlResource, ClassPathResource, FileSystemResource, PathResource, ServletContextResource, InputStreamResource, and ByteArrayResource. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/resources.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ResourceLoader interface in Spring?","The ResourceLoader interface is meant to be implemented by objects that can return (that is, load) Resource instances. All application contexts implement the ResourceLoader interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/resources.html)"
"Why is it important for validation to not be tied to the web tier?","It is important for validation to not be tied to the web tier because validation should be easy to localize and it should be possible to plug in any available validator. This allows for flexibility and adaptability in different layers of an application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Validator contract provided by Spring?","The Validator contract provided by Spring is both basic and eminently usable in every layer of an application. It allows for validation that is not tied to the web tier and is easy to localize, and it allows for plugging in any available validator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the DataBinder in Spring?","The DataBinder in Spring is used for letting user input be dynamically bound to the domain model of an application (or whatever objects you use to process user input). It is part of the validation package and is primarily used in but not limited to the web layer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Validator interface in Spring?","The Validator interface in Spring is used to validate objects. It works by using an Errors object so that, while validating, validators can report validation failures to the Errors object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/validator.html)"
"How can you implement a Validator for a specific class in Spring?","To implement a Validator for a specific class in Spring, you need to implement the following two methods of the org.springframework.validation.Validator interface: supports(Class) and validate(Object, org.springframework.validation.Errors). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/validator.html)"
"How can you reuse validation logic in Spring using a Validator?","You can reuse validation logic in Spring using a Validator by encapsulating the validation logic for each nested class of object in its own Validator implementation and dependency-injecting or instantiating the relevant Validator within your main Validator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/validator.html)"
"What is data binding in Spring and how does it work?","Data binding in Spring is a process of binding user input to a target object. It works by using the DataBinder class, which provides two ways to bind user input: constructor binding and property binding. Constructor binding binds user input to a public data constructor, while property binding binds user input to setters. The target class should have a single public or non-public constructor with arguments. Type conversion is applied as needed to convert user input. If the constructor parameter is an object, it is constructed recursively in the same manner, but through a nested property path. Binding and conversion errors are reflected in the BindingResult of the DataBinder. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html>)"
"What is the BeanWrapper class in Spring and what does it do?","The BeanWrapper class in Spring adheres to the JavaBeans standard and offers functionality to set and get property values, get property descriptors, and query properties to determine if they are readable or writable. It also supports nested properties, enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth. The BeanWrapper usually is not used by application code directly but is used by the DataBinder and the BeanFactory. The way the BeanWrapper works is partly indicated by its name: it wraps a bean to perform actions on that bean, such as setting and retrieving properties. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html>)"
"What are PropertyEditors in Spring and how are they used?","PropertyEditors in Spring are used to effect the conversion between an Object and a String. They can be handy to represent properties in a different way than the object itself. Spring uses the concept of a PropertyEditor to convert properties to the desired type. PropertyEditors are registered on a BeanWrapper or in a specific IoC container. Spring has a number of built-in PropertyEditor implementations to make life easy. They are all located in the org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors package. Most, (but not all) are, by default, registered by BeanWrapperImpl. PropertyEditors can be registered manually for custom types or to override the default behavior. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html>)"
"How does Spring Framework handle the registration of error codes during validation?","Spring Framework uses a MessageCodesResolver to determine which error codes the Errors interface registers. By default, the DefaultMessageCodesResolver is used, which registers the code you provided and additional error codes that include the field name and type. This is done for convenience when targeting error messages. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/MessageCodesResolver.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the rejectValue method in Spring Framework's Errors interface?","The rejectValue method is used to reject a field during validation and register the provided error code. Additionally, the DefaultMessageCodesResolver registers additional error codes that include the field name and type for convenience when targeting error messages. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/conversion.html>)"
"How can developers use the MessageSource to output validation error messages in Spring Framework?","Developers can use the error code provided when rejecting a field during validation to output the corresponding error message using the MessageSource. The DefaultMessageCodesResolver registers additional error codes that include the field name and type, making it easier to target error messages. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/conversion.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring Type Conversion system?","The purpose of the Spring Type Conversion system is to provide a general type conversion system that defines an SPI to implement type conversion logic and an API to perform type conversions at runtime. It can be used as an alternative to PropertyEditor implementations to convert externalized bean property value strings to the required property types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/convert.html)"
"How do you implement a custom converter in Spring Type Conversion?","To create your own converter, you need to implement the Converter interface and parameterize S as the type you are converting from and T as the type you are converting to. You can also transparently apply such a converter if a collection or array of S needs to be converted to an array or collection of T, provided that a delegating array or collection converter has been registered as well. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/convert.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ConverterFactory interface in Spring Type Conversion?","The ConverterFactory interface is used when you need to centralize the conversion logic for an entire class hierarchy. You can implement ConverterFactory to define a base type defining the range of classes you can convert to and then implement getConverter(Class<T>) where T is a subclass of R. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/convert.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Formatter SPI in Spring Framework?","The Formatter SPI in Spring Framework is designed to provide a simple and robust alternative to PropertyEditor implementations for client environments. It is used to implement field formatting logic and is particularly useful when working in a client environment (such as a web application) and needing to parse and print localized field values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/format.html)"
"How can I create my own Formatter implementation in Spring Framework?","To create your own Formatter implementation in Spring Framework, you need to implement the Formatter interface, which extends from the Printer and Parser building-block interfaces. Implement the print() operation to print an instance of T for display in the client locale, and implement the parse() operation to parse an instance of T from the formatted representation returned from the client locale. Your Formatter should throw a ParseException or an IllegalArgumentException if a parse attempt fails. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/format.html)"
"What is the difference between the Converter SPI and the Formatter SPI in Spring Framework?","The Converter SPI is used to implement general-purpose type conversion logic, such as converting between a java.util.Date and a Long. On the other hand, the Formatter SPI is designed to handle the type conversion requirements of typical client environments, such as web or desktop applications, which often involve converting from String to support the client postback process and back to String to support the view rendering process. Additionally, the Formatter SPI is used to localize String values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/format.html)"
"What is Java Bean Validation and how does Spring Framework support it?","Java Bean Validation is a framework that provides a common way of validation through constraint declaration and metadata for Java applications. The Spring Framework provides full support for the Java Bean Validation API, including the bootstrapping of a Bean Validation provider as a Spring bean. This allows you to inject a jakarta.validation.ValidatorFactory or jakarta.validation.Validator wherever validation is needed in your application."
"How can you declare constraints using Bean Validation?","Constraints can be declared by annotating domain model properties with declarative validation constraints. These constraints are then enforced by the runtime. There are built-in constraints, and you can also define your own custom constraints. For example, you can use annotations like @NotNull, @Size, and @Min to declare constraints on a property."
"How can you configure a Bean Validation provider as a Spring bean?","You can use the LocalValidatorFactoryBean to configure a default Validator as a Spring bean. The basic configuration triggers bean validation to initialize by using its default bootstrap mechanism. A Bean Validation provider, such as the Hibernate Validator, is expected to be present in the classpath and is automatically detected. You can inject a reference to the jakarta.validation.Validator or the org.springframework.validation.Validator as needed."
"What is the purpose of the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) in the Spring portfolio?","The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. It is designed to provide the Spring community with a single well-supported expression language that can be used across all the products in the Spring portfolio. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions.html)"
"How is the SpEL language syntax similar to Jakarta Expression Language?","The SpEL language syntax is similar to the Jakarta Expression Language, but it offers additional features, most notably method invocation and basic string templating functionality. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions.html)"
"Can SpEL be used independently of Spring?","Yes, while SpEL serves as the foundation for expression evaluation within the Spring portfolio, it is not directly tied to Spring and can be used independently. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ExpressionParser interface in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and what does it do?","The ExpressionParser interface in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is responsible for parsing an expression string. It takes an expression string as input and returns an Expression object that can be used to evaluate the expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/evaluation.html)"
"What are the two types of exceptions that can be thrown when calling parser.parseExpression(…​) and exp.getValue(…​) in SpEL?","The two types of exceptions that can be thrown when calling parser.parseExpression(…​) and exp.getValue(…​) in SpEL are ParseException and EvaluationException, respectively. A ParseException is thrown when there is a problem parsing the expression string, while an EvaluationException is thrown when there is a problem evaluating the expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/evaluation.html)"
"What is the difference between SimpleEvaluationContext and StandardEvaluationContext in SpEL?","SimpleEvaluationContext is designed to support only a subset of the SpEL language syntax, while StandardEvaluationContext provides the full set of SpEL language features and configuration options. SimpleEvaluationContext is useful for categories of expressions that do not require the full extent of the SpEL language syntax and should be meaningfully restricted, such as data binding expressions and property-based filters. StandardEvaluationContext can be used to specify a default root object and to configure every available evaluation-related strategy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/evaluation.html)"
"What is the Spring Expression Language and where can I find more information about it?","The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that can be used within Spring applications. You can find more information about it in the Language Reference section of the Spring Framework reference guide, which is available at <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref.html>."
"How do you create an inline list using the Spring Expression Language?","To create an inline list using the Spring Expression Language, you can use the following syntax: {element1, element2, ..., elementN}. For example, to create a list with the elements 'a', 'b', and 'c', you would use the expression: {a, b, c}. You can find more information about this in the Inline Lists section of the Language Reference, available at <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>."
"How do you access a property of a bean using the Spring Expression Language?","To access a property of a bean using the Spring Expression Language, you can use the following syntax: beanName.propertyName. For example, to access the property 'name' of a bean named 'myBean', you would use the expression: myBean.name. You can find more information about this in the Bean References section of the Language Reference, available at <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/bean-references.html>."
"How are strings represented in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) literal expressions?","In Spring Expression Language (SpEL), strings can be represented using single quotation marks (' ') or double quotation marks ("" ""). To include a single quotation mark within a string enclosed in single quotation marks, use two adjacent single quotation mark characters. Similarly, to include a double quotation mark within a string enclosed in double quotation marks, use two adjacent double quotation mark characters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/literal.html)"
"How are literal numbers represented in SpEL, and what are the supported types?","Literal numbers in SpEL can be represented as integers, longs, hexadecimals, floats, and doubles. By default, real numbers are parsed using Double.parseDouble(). Due to the design and implementation of SpEL, literal numbers are always stored internally as positive numbers. For example, -2 is stored internally as a positive 2 which is then negated while evaluating the expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/literal.html)"
"How can you represent the minimum value for a particular type of number within a SpEL expression?","To represent the minimum value for a particular type of number within a SpEL expression, you can either reference the MIN_VALUE constant for the respective wrapper type (such as Integer.MIN_VALUE, Long.MIN_VALUE, etc.) or calculate the minimum value. For example, to use the minimum integer value, you can use T(Integer).MIN_VALUE (requiring a StandardEvaluationContext) or -2^31 (which can be used with any type of EvaluationContext). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/literal.html)"
"How can you represent lists in an expression using Spring Expression Language?","You can directly express lists in an expression by using {} notation. For example, List numbers = (List) parser.parseExpression(""{1,2,3,4}"").getValue(context); (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>)"
"What does {} mean when used by itself in Spring Expression Language?","{} by itself means an empty list. For performance reasons, if the list is itself entirely composed of fixed literals, a constant list is created to represent the expression (rather than building a new list on each evaluation). (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>)"
"How can you represent a list of lists in an expression using Spring Expression Language?","You can represent a list of lists in an expression by using nested {} notation. For example, List listOfLists = (List) parser.parseExpression(""{{'a','b'},{'x','y'}}"").getValue(context); (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-lists.html>)"
"What is the syntax for directly expressing maps in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and how can you create a map with fixed literals?","In Spring Expression Language (SpEL), you can directly express maps using {key:value} notation. To create a map with fixed literals, you can use constant structures like lists or maps. For example: {name:'Nikola',dob:'10-July-1856'}. For performance reasons, a constant map is created to represent the expression, which is more efficient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-maps.html)"
"Can you use quoted keys when expressing maps in SpEL, and when is quoting necessary?","Quoting of the map keys is optional in SpEL, unless the key contains a period (.). If the key does not contain a period, you can use unquoted keys. For example: {name:'Nikola',dob:'10-July-1856'}. In the provided examples, the keys are not quoted. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/expressions/language-ref/inline-maps.html)"
"How can you create a map of maps in SpEL and what is the syntax for nested constant structures?","To create a map of maps in SpEL, you can use nested {key:value} notation. For example: {name:{first:'Nikola',last:'Tesla'},dob:{day:10,month:'July',year:1856}}. This creates a map with two entries, where the values are themselves maps containing fixed literals.

"What is a join point in Spring AOP?","A join point in Spring AOP is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/introduction-defn.html)"
"What is advice in Spring AOP?","Advice in Spring AOP is action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include 'around', 'before', and 'after' advice. Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an interceptor and maintain a chain of interceptors around the join point. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/introduction-defn.html)"

"What is the difference between around advice and before advice in Spring Boot?","Around advice runs 'around' a matched method’s execution and has the opportunity to do work both before and after the method runs and to determine when, how, and even if the method actually gets to run at all. Before advice, on the other hand, runs before a matched method execution. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/advice.html>)"
"What are introductions in AspectJ and how do they work?","Introductions, also known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ, enable an aspect to declare that advised objects implement a given interface and provide an implementation of that interface on behalf of those objects. This is done using the @DeclareParents annotation, which is used to declare that matching types have a new parent. For example, given an interface named UsageTracked and an implementation of that interface named DefaultUsageTracked, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service interfaces also implement the UsageTracked interface: Java Kotlin @Aspect public class UsageTracking { @DeclareParents(value=""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl=DefaultUsageTracked.class) public static UsageTracked mixin; @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") public void recordUsage(UsageTracked usageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount(); } } @Aspect class UsageTracking { companion object { @DeclareParents(value = ""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl = DefaultUsageTracked::class) lateinit var mixin: UsageTracked } @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") fun recordUsage(usageTracked: UsageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount() } } (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/introductions.html})"
"How can I make an introduction using the @DeclareParents annotation?","To make an introduction using the @DeclareParents annotation, you need to annotate a field in your aspect class. The type of the annotated field determines the interface to be implemented. The value attribute of the @DeclareParents annotation is an AspectJ type pattern. Any bean of a matching type implements the UsageTracked interface. For example, given an interface named UsageTracked and an implementation of that interface named DefaultUsageTracked, the following aspect declares that all implementors of service interfaces also implement the UsageTracked interface: Java Kotlin @Aspect public class UsageTracking { @DeclareParents(value=""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl=DefaultUsageTracked.class) public static UsageTracked mixin; @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") public void recordUsage(UsageTracked usageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount(); } } @Aspect class UsageTracking { companion object { @DeclareParents(value = ""com.xyz.service.*+"", defaultImpl = DefaultUsageTracked::class) lateinit var mixin: UsageTracked } @Before(""execution(* com.xyz..service.*.*(..)) && this(usageTracked)"") fun recordUsage(usageTracked: UsageTracked) { usageTracked.incrementUseCount() } } (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/introductions.html})"
"How can I access a bean programmatically if it implements an interface introduced by an aspect?","If a bean implements an interface introduced by an aspect, you can access it programmatically by using the following code: Java Kotlin UsageTracked usageTracked = context.getBean(""myService"", UsageTracked.class); val usageTracked = context.getBean(""myService"", UsageTracked.class) This code retrieves the bean with the name ""myService"" and casts it to the UsageTracked interface.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/instantiation-models.html)"
"What is the purpose of the aspect implementation in the given example?","The purpose of the aspect implementation is to transparently retry a business service operation if it fails due to concurrency issues, such as a deadlock loser. This is achieved using around advice to call proceed multiple times. The aspect is implemented with the Ordered interface to set its precedence higher than the transaction advice, and the maxRetries and order properties are configured by Spring. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/example.html)"
"How does the aspect implementation determine when to retry a business service operation?","The aspect implementation determines when to retry a business service operation by catching a PessimisticLockingFailureException and incrementing a retry counter.

"How can the aspect implementation be refined to only retry idempotent operations?","The aspect implementation can be refined to only retry idempotent operations by defining an Idempotent annotation and using it to annotate the implementation of service operations. The pointcut expression in the aspect can then be refined to only match @Idempotent operations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/example.html)"
"What is the purpose of using the aop namespace tags in Spring?","The aop namespace tags in Spring are used to define aspects and provide support for schema-based AOP configuration. They allow you to define pointcuts, advisors, and aspects within an <aop:config> element, and use the same pointcut expressions and advice kinds as in the @AspectJ style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/schema.html)"
"How do you declare an aspect using the schema-based AOP support in Spring?","To declare an aspect using the schema-based AOP support in Spring, you use the <aop:aspect> element and reference the backing bean using the ref attribute. The bean that backs the aspect must be configured and dependency injected just like any other Spring bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/schema.html)"
"What is the difference between declaring a pointcut inside an aspect and declaring a top-level pointcut in Spring's schema-based AOP support?","Declaring a pointcut inside an aspect is similar to declaring a top-level pointcut, but pointcuts defined in this way are referred to by their XML id and cannot be used as named pointcuts to form composite pointcuts. The named pointcut support in the schema-based definition style is more limited than that offered by the @AspectJ style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/schema.html)"
"What are some factors to consider when deciding between using Spring AOP or AspectJ?","The factors to consider when deciding between using Spring AOP or AspectJ include application requirements, development tools, and team familiarity with AOP. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/choosing.html)"
"When should you use Spring AOP over AspectJ?","You should use Spring AOP over AspectJ when you only need to advise the execution of operations on Spring beans and when you want to avoid introducing the AspectJ compiler/weaver into your development and build processes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/choosing.html)"
"What are the advantages of using the @AspectJ style over the XML style for Spring AOP?","The advantages of using the @AspectJ style over the XML style for Spring AOP include better encapsulation of the aspect implementation, richer pointcut composition, and the ability to be understood and consumed by both Spring AOP and AspectJ. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/choosing.html)"
"Is it possible to combine different aspect types in a Spring AOP configuration?","Yes, it is possible to mix @AspectJ style aspects, schema-defined <aop:aspect> aspects, <aop:advisor> declared advisors, and even proxies and interceptors in other styles in the same configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/mixing-styles.html)"
"How are the different aspect types in a Spring AOP configuration implemented?","All of these aspect types are implemented using the same underlying support mechanism. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/mixing-styles.html)"
"Can different aspect types co-exist in a Spring AOP configuration without any issues?","Yes, all of these aspect types can co-exist without any difficulty. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/mixing-styles.html)"
"What are the two proxying mechanisms used by Spring AOP?","JDK dynamic proxies and CGLIB (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/proxying.html)"
"When is a JDK dynamic proxy used instead of a CGLIB proxy?","If the target object to be proxied implements at least one interface, a JDK dynamic proxy is used. If the target object does not implement any interfaces, a CGLIB proxy is created. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/proxying.html)"
"What are the limitations of using CGLIB proxies in Spring AOP?","Final methods cannot be advised with CGLIB proxies, as they cannot be overridden in runtime-generated subclasses. Additionally, there may be limitations with the JDK 9+ platform module system, and the JVM may not allow for constructor bypassing, leading to double invocations and corresponding debug log entries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/proxying.html)"
"How can I programmatically create @AspectJ proxies in Spring Boot?","You can use the org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.AspectJProxyFactory class to create a proxy for a target object that is advised by one or more @AspectJ aspects. The basic usage for this class is very simple, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin // create a factory that can generate a proxy for the given target object AspectJProxyFactory factory = new AspectJProxyFactory(targetObject); // add an aspect, the class must be an @AspectJ aspect // you can call this as many times as you need with different aspects factory.addAspect(SecurityManager.class); // you can also add existing aspect instances, the type of the object supplied // must be an @AspectJ aspect factory.addAspect(usageTracker); // now get the proxy object... MyInterfaceType proxy = factory.getProxy(); // create a factory that can generate a proxy for the given target object val factory = AspectJProxyFactory(targetObject) // add an aspect, the class must be an @AspectJ aspect // you can call this as many times as you need with different aspects factory.addAspect(SecurityManager::class.java) // you can also add existing aspect instances, the type of the object supplied // must be an @AspectJ aspect factory.addAspect(usageTracker) // now get the proxy object... val proxy = factory.getProxy<Any>() See the javadoc(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/aspectj/annotation/AspectJProxyFactory.html) for more information.(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/aspectj-programmatic.html)"

"What is the purpose of the AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect in spring-aspects.jar?","The AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect in spring-aspects.jar is used to implement the @Configurable support, which allows dependency injection of any object, including domain objects created outside of the control of any container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/using-aspectj.html)"
"How can you configure AspectJ aspects with Spring?","To configure AspectJ aspects with Spring, you can create a bean definition that references the aspect type as normal and include the factory-method='aspectOf' bean attribute. This ensures that Spring obtains the aspect instance by asking AspectJ for it rather than trying to create an instance itself. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/using-aspectj.html)"
"What is the purpose of the META-INF/aop.xml file in AspectJ load-time weaving (LTW)?","The META-INF/aop.xml file is used to inform the AspectJ weaver about which aspects to weave into the classes in your application. It is a standard AspectJ convention and is required for LTW. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/using-aspectj.html)"
"Where can I find more information on AspectJ?","You can find more information on AspectJ on the AspectJ website(https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj)."
"What book provides a comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language?","Eclipse AspectJ by Adrian Colyer et. al. (Addison-Wesley, 2005) provides a comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language."
"Which book is highly recommended for learning about AspectJ and general AOP themes?","AspectJ in Action , Second Edition by Ramnivas Laddad (Manning, 2009) comes highly recommended. The focus of the book is on AspectJ, but a lot of general AOP themes are explored (in some depth)."
"What are the three main APIs discussed in the Spring AOP chapter?","The three main APIs discussed in the Spring AOP chapter are the Pointcut API, Advice API, and Advisor API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api.html)"
"Which class is used to create AOP proxies programmatically?","The ProxyFactory class is used to create AOP proxies programmatically. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api.html)"
"What is the recommended approach for using Spring AOP?","The recommended approach for using Spring AOP is to use Spring AOP with AspectJ pointcuts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api.html)"
"What is the central interface used to target advice to particular classes and methods in Spring's pointcut model?","The central interface used to target advice to particular classes and methods in Spring's pointcut model is the org.springframework.aop.Pointcut interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pointcuts.html)"
"What does the ClassFilter interface in Spring's Pointcut interface do?","The ClassFilter interface in Spring's Pointcut interface is used to restrict the pointcut to a given set of target classes. If the matches() method always returns true, all target classes are matched. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pointcuts.html)"
"What is the main type of pointcut used by Spring since 2.0?","The main type of pointcut used by Spring since 2.0 is the org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJExpressionPointcut, which uses an AspectJ-supplied library to parse an AspectJ pointcut expression string. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pointcuts.html)"
"What is the main advantage of a before advice in Spring AOP?","The main advantage of a before advice is that there is no need to invoke the proceed() method and, therefore, no possibility of inadvertently failing to proceed down the interceptor chain. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advice.html)"
"How can you add a check in the invoke() method of a LockMixin class to prevent setter methods from being invoked when in locked mode?","In the LockMixin class, you can add a check in the invoke() method to prevent setter methods from being invoked when in locked mode by using the following code: if (locked() && invocation.getMethod().getName().indexOf('set') == 0) { throw new LockedException(); } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advice.html)"
"What is the difference between per-class and per-instance advice in Spring AOP?","Per-class advice is used most often and is appropriate for generic advice, such as transaction advisors. These do not depend on the state of the proxied object or add new state. They merely act on the method and arguments. Per-instance advice, on the other hand, is appropriate for introductions, to support mixins. In this case, the advice adds state to the proxied object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advice.html)"
"What is an Advisor in Spring?","An Advisor in Spring is an aspect that contains a single advice object associated with a pointcut expression. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advisor.html)"
"What is the most commonly used advisor class in Spring?","The most commonly used advisor class in Spring is org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advisor.html)"
"Is it possible to mix advisor and advice types in Spring?","Yes, it is possible to mix advisor and advice types in Spring in the same AOP proxy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/advisor.html)"
"How can I use ProxyFactoryBean to create an AOP proxy in Spring?","To create an AOP proxy in Spring using ProxyFactoryBean, you need to define a ProxyFactoryBean named foo and use it to create an AOP proxy that wraps a target object. This allows advice and pointcuts to be managed by IoC, providing a powerful feature that is hard to achieve with other AOP frameworks. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pfb.html)"
"What is the difference between JDK-based and CGLIB-based proxies in Spring?","JDK-based proxies are interface-based and can only be used if the target class implements one or more interfaces. CGLIB-based proxies, on the other hand, can be used with any target class, including classes that do not implement any interfaces. The ProxyFactoryBean automatically detects the type of proxy to create based on the target class and the configuration of the bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pfb.html)"
"How can I use ProxyFactoryBean to advice a class that does not implement any interfaces?","To advice a class that does not implement any interfaces, you can set the proxyTargetClass property on the ProxyFactoryBean to true, which will force Spring to use CGLIB proxying. CGLIB proxying works by generating a subclass of the target class at runtime, which can then be used to implement the Decorator pattern and weave in the advice. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/pfb.html)"
"What is the purpose of creating a parent, template bean definition for a proxy in Spring?","The purpose of creating a parent, template bean definition for a proxy in Spring is to define a reusable and concise proxy definition that can be used as a base for multiple proxy definitions. This allows for cleaner and more efficient proxy configurations, especially when dealing with transactional proxies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/concise-proxy.html)"
"What is the advantage of using parent and child bean definitions for proxy definitions in Spring?","Using parent and child bean definitions for proxy definitions in Spring offers several advantages. It allows for the reuse of common proxy properties, reduces redundancy in proxy definitions, and makes it easier to manage and maintain proxy configurations. By using a parent bean definition as a template, you can define a set of default proxy properties that can be overridden or extended in child bean definitions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/concise-proxy.html)"
"How can you override properties from a parent template bean definition in Spring?","To override properties from a parent template bean definition in Spring, you can use the property element within the child bean definition. For example, in the case of transactional proxies, you can override the transaction propagation settings by specifying the transactionAttributes property within the child bean definition. This allows you to customize the proxy properties for each individual proxy without modifying the parent template. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/concise-proxy.html)"
"How can you create AOP proxies programmatically in Spring without relying on Spring IoC?","You can create AOP proxies programmatically with Spring by using the ProxyFactory class. The interfaces implemented by the target object are automatically proxied. The first step is to construct an object of type org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory. You can add advice, advisors, or both and manipulate them for the life of the ProxyFactory. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/prog.html)"
"What is the advantage of integrating AOP proxy creation with the IoC framework in Spring applications?","Integrating AOP proxy creation with the IoC framework is best practice in most Spring applications. It is recommended to externalize configuration from Java code with AOP, as you should in general. This practice helps to separate concerns and improve the maintainability and scalability of your application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/prog.html)"
"Can you add additional interfaces to the proxy using the ProxyFactory in Spring AOP?","Yes, you can add additional interfaces to the proxy using the ProxyFactory in Spring AOP by adding an IntroductionInterceptionAroundAdvisor. This will cause the proxy to implement additional interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/prog.html)"
"How can you manipulate AOP proxies in Spring Boot?","You can manipulate AOP proxies in Spring Boot by using the org.springframework.aop.framework.Advised interface. Any AOP proxy can be cast to this interface, no matter which other interfaces it implements. This interface includes various methods such as getAdvisors(), addAdvice(), addAdvisor(), indexOf(), removeAdvisor(), replaceAdvisor(), and isFrozen(). The getAdvisors() method returns an Advisor for every advisor, interceptor, or other advice type that has been added to the factory. The addAdvisor() methods can be used to add any Advisor. By default, it is possible to add or remove advisors or interceptors even once a proxy has been created, unless the proxy has been frozen."
"What is the role of the Advised interface in Spring Boot AOP?","The Advised interface in Spring Boot AOP plays a crucial role in manipulating AOP proxies. It provides various methods to interact with the proxies, such as retrieving the advisors, adding or removing advice, and checking if the proxy is frozen. This interface allows developers to examine and modify the advice on a business object, which can be particularly useful in development, for example, in tests when adding test code in the form of an interceptor or other advice."
"How can you add selective advice using a pointcut in Spring Boot AOP?","To add selective advice using a pointcut in Spring Boot AOP, you can use the addAdvisor() methods provided by the Advised interface. These methods can be used to add any Advisor. Usually, the advisor holding pointcut and advice is the generic DefaultPointcutAdvisor, which you can use with any advice or pointcut (but not for introductions). By default, it is possible to add or remove advisors or interceptors even once a proxy has been created. The following example demonstrates how to add selective advice using a pointcut: advised.addAdvisor(new DefaultPointcutAdvisor(mySpecialPointcut, myAdvice));"
"What is the purpose of the auto-proxy facility in Spring?","The auto-proxy facility in Spring allows for the automatic creation of AOP proxies for selected bean definitions. It is built on Spring's 'bean post processor' infrastructure, which enables modification of any bean definition as the container loads. This facility is useful for applying the same configuration consistently to multiple objects with minimal volume of configuration. It is a popular choice for applying declarative transactions to multiple objects. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/autoproxy.html)"
"What is the difference between BeanNameAutoProxyCreator and DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator?","BeanNameAutoProxyCreator is a BeanPostProcessor that automatically creates AOP proxies for beans with names that match literal values or wildcards. It requires specifying the bean names in the auto-proxy creator's bean definition. On the other hand, DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator automatically applies eligible advisors in the current context without the need to include specific bean names. It is more general and powerful, as it can apply any number of advisors to each business object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/autoproxy.html)"
"How does DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator evaluate which advice to apply to each business object?","DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator automatically evaluates the pointcut contained in each advisor to see what (if any) advice it should apply to each business object. This means that any number of advisors can be applied automatically to each business object. If no pointcut in any of the advisors matches any method in a business object, the object is not proxied. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/autoproxy.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TargetSource interface in Spring AOP?","The TargetSource interface in Spring AOP is responsible for returning the ‘target object’ that implements the join point. It is asked for a target instance each time the AOP proxy handles a method invocation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/targetsource.html)"
"What is the difference between a pooling TargetSource and a prototype TargetSource in Spring AOP?","A pooling TargetSource maintains a pool of identical instances, while a prototype TargetSource creates a new instance of the target on every method invocation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/targetsource.html)"
"How can you change the target of a HotSwappableTargetSource in Spring AOP?","You can change the target of a HotSwappableTargetSource by using the swap() method on HotSwappableTargetSource. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/targetsource.html)"
"How can new advice types be supported in Spring AOP without modifying the core framework?","Spring AOP's extensibility allows for the addition of new custom advice types without changing the core framework. This is achieved through the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter SPI package. The only requirement for a custom Advice type is that it must implement the org.aopalliance.aop.Advice marker interface. For more information, refer to the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter javadoc (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/extensibility.html)"
"What is the constraint for implementing a custom Advice type in Spring AOP?","For a custom Advice type to be implemented in Spring AOP, it must implement the org.aopalliance.aop.Advice marker interface. This is the only constraint. For further information, refer to the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter javadoc (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/extensibility.html)"
"What is the role of the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter package in Spring AOP?","The org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter package in Spring AOP is a Service Provider Interface (SPI) package that enables support for new custom advice types without altering the core framework. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of arbitrary advice types in addition to the existing interception around, before, throws, and after returning advice. For more information, refer to the org.springframework.aop.framework.adapter javadoc (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop-api/extensibility.html)"
"What are the Spring Framework's annotations for declaring nullability of APIs and fields?","The Spring Framework provides the following annotations in the org.springframework.lang package to declare nullability of APIs and fields: @Nullable, @NonNull, @NonNullApi, and @NonNullFields. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @NonNullApi and @NonNullFields annotations?","The @NonNullApi and @NonNullFields annotations are used to declare non-null as the default semantics for parameters, return values, and fields, respectively. They can be used at the package level to make the entire package null-safe. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html)"
"How do I use the Spring Framework's null-safety annotations in my project?","To use the Spring Framework's null-safety annotations in your project, you can add the relevant annotations to your API and field declarations. For example, you can use @Nullable to indicate that a specific parameter, return value, or field can be null, and @NonNull to indicate that a specific parameter, return value, or field cannot be null. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html)"
"What are the main benefits of using DataBuffer over java.nio.ByteBuffer?","The DataBuffer interface offers similar operations as java.nio.ByteBuffer but also brings a few additional benefits some of which are inspired by the Netty ByteBuf. Some of these benefits include read and write with independent positions, capacity expanded on demand, pooled buffers and reference counting via PooledDataBuffer, and the ability to view a buffer as java.nio.ByteBuffer, InputStream, or OutputStream. It also offers methods to determine the index or the last index for a given byte. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/databuffer-codec.html)"
"What is the role of DataBufferFactory and how is it used in WebFlux applications?","DataBufferFactory is used to create data buffers in one of two ways: Allocate a new data buffer, optionally specifying capacity upfront, which is more efficient even though implementations of DataBuffer can grow and shrink on demand. Wrap an existing byte[] or java.nio.ByteBuffer, which decorates the given data with a DataBuffer implementation and that does not involve allocation. Note that WebFlux applications do not create a DataBufferFactory directly but instead access it through the ServerHttpResponse or the ClientHttpRequest on the client side. The type of factory depends on the underlying client or server, e.g. NettyDataBufferFactory for Reactor Netty, DefaultDataBufferFactory for others. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/databuffer-codec.html)"
"What is the purpose of Codecs in Spring Framework and what are the different types of codecs provided?","Codecs in Spring Framework are used to decode or encode data buffer streams into higher level objects. The org.springframework.core.codec package provides the following strategy interfaces: Encoder to encode Publisher<T> into a stream of data buffers, and Decoder to decode Publisher<DataBuffer> into a stream of higher level objects. The spring-core module provides byte[], ByteBuffer, DataBuffer, Resource, and String encoder and decoder implementations. The spring-web module adds Jackson JSON, Jackson Smile, JAXB2, Protocol Buffers and other encoders and decoders.

"What logging implementation does Spring Boot use by default since version 5.0?","Spring Boot uses Commons Logging bridge implemented in the spring-jcl module by default since version 5.0. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/spring-jcl.html)"
"How does Spring Boot determine which logging implementation to use?","Spring Boot checks for the presence of Log4j 2.x API and SLF4J 1.7 API in the classpath and uses the first one found as the logging implementation, falling back to Java platform's core logging facilities (JUL) if neither is available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/spring-jcl.html)"
"What are the recommended logging implementations for application code within Spring Boot?","For logging needs within application code, Spring Boot recommends direct use of Log4j 2.x, SLF4J, or JUL. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/spring-jcl.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's support for AOT optimizations?","Spring's support for Ahead of Time (AOT) optimizations is meant to inspect an ApplicationContext at build time and apply decisions and discovery logic that usually happens at runtime. This allows building an application startup arrangement that is more straightforward and focused on a fixed set of features based mainly on the classpath and the Environment. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html)"
"What restrictions apply when using Spring's AOT optimizations?","When using Spring's AOT optimizations, the following restrictions apply: The classpath is fixed and fully defined at build time, the beans defined in your application cannot change at runtime, @Profile-specific configuration needs to be chosen at build time, environment properties that impact the presence of a bean are only considered at build time, bean definitions with instance suppliers cannot be transformed ahead-of-time, and beans registered as singletons cannot be transformed ahead-of-time. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html)"
"How does the AOT engine process a Spring application?","The AOT engine for processing a Spring ApplicationContext starts with ApplicationContextAotGenerator, which takes care of refreshing an ApplicationContext for AOT processing, invoking available BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor implementations, and applying their contributions against the GenerationContext. This process updates the GenerationContext with the generated code, resources, and classes necessary for the application to run. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aot.html)"
"What is the purpose of XML schemas in the context of Spring Boot?","XML schemas provide a way to define and validate the structure of XML documents. In Spring Boot, XML schemas are used to define the structure of configuration files, such as those used for setting up beans and dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix.html#xsd-schemas)"
"How can you create custom XML schemas for use in Spring Boot applications?","To create custom XML schemas for use in Spring Boot applications, you can use the XML Schema Definition (XSD) language. You can define your own elements, attributes, and types, and then use these custom schemas in your Spring Boot configuration files. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix.html#xml-custom)"
"What are the steps involved in the application startup process in Spring Boot?","The application startup process in Spring Boot involves several steps, including environment initialization, context initialization, and context refreshing. During these steps, Spring Boot loads the application context, initializes beans, and performs any necessary configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix.html#application-startup-steps)"
"What is the purpose of the <util:properties> element in Spring XML configuration?","The <util:properties> element is used to create a java.util.Properties instance with values loaded from the supplied location. This element is a more concise representation of using a Spring FactoryBean implementation (the PropertiesFactoryBean) to instantiate a java.util.Properties instance with values loaded from the supplied Resource location. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xsd-schemas.html)"
"What is the difference between using <util:list> and the ListFactoryBean in Spring XML configuration?","The <util:list> element is a more concise way to create a java.util.List instance and initialize it with values. It is an alternative to using a Spring FactoryBean implementation (the ListFactoryBean) to create a java.util.List instance with values loaded from the supplied 'sourceList'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xsd-schemas.html)"
"How can I explicitly control the type of Map that is instantiated and populated using the <util:map> element in Spring XML configuration?","To explicitly control the type of Map that is instantiated and populated using the <util:map> element, you can use the 'map-class' attribute. For example, if you need a java.util.TreeMap to be instantiated, you can use the following configuration: <util:map id='emails' map-class='java.util.TreeMap'>. If no 'map-class' attribute is supplied, the container chooses a Map implementation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xsd-schemas.html)"
"What is the process to create a custom XML bean definition parser in Spring?","To create a custom XML bean definition parser in Spring, you need to author an XML schema to describe your custom element(s), code a custom NamespaceHandler implementation, code one or more BeanDefinitionParser implementations, and register your new artifacts with Spring. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xml-custom.html)"
"What is the purpose of a NamespaceHandler in Spring?","A NamespaceHandler in Spring is responsible for parsing all elements of a specific namespace and is called when Spring encounters a top-level element. It can register bean definitions, return a bean definition, or both. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xml-custom.html)"
"What is the role of a BeanDefinitionParser in Spring?","A BeanDefinitionParser in Spring is responsible for parsing one distinct top-level XML element defined in the schema. It provides the logic for parsing a single custom element. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/appendix/xml-custom.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'spring.beans.instantiate' startup step in the Spring Boot application?","The 'spring.beans.instantiate' startup step in the Spring Boot application is responsible for the instantiation of a bean and its dependencies.

"What is the main advantage of dependency injection in Spring Boot for unit testing?","The main advantage of dependency injection in Spring Boot for unit testing is that it makes your code less dependent on the container than it would be with traditional J2EE / Java EE development. This allows your POJOs to be testable in JUnit or TestNG tests, with objects instantiated by using the new operator, without Spring or any other container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/unit.html)"
"What is the purpose of using mock objects in Spring Boot unit testing?","The purpose of using mock objects in Spring Boot unit testing is to test your code in isolation. Mock objects can be used in conjunction with other testing techniques to facilitate easier unit testing. By following the architecture recommendations for Spring, the resulting clean layering and componentization of your codebase makes it easier to test service layer objects by stubbing or mocking DAO or repository interfaces, without needing to access persistent data while running unit tests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/unit.html)"
"What are the different packages in Spring that provide mock objects for testing?","Spring includes several packages dedicated to mocking, such as Environment, JNDI, Servlet API, and Spring Web Reactive. The org.springframework.mock.env package contains mock implementations of the Environment and PropertySource abstractions. The org.springframework.mock.jndi package contains a partial implementation of the JNDI SPI, which you can use to set up a simple JNDI environment for test suites or stand-alone applications. The org.springframework.mock.web package contains a comprehensive set of Servlet API mock objects that are useful for testing web contexts, controllers, and filters. The org.springframework.mock.http.server.reactive and org.springframework.mock.web.server packages contain mock implementations of ServerHttpRequest, ServerHttpResponse, and ServerWebExchange for use in WebFlux applications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/unit.html)"
"What is the purpose of integration testing in Spring Framework?","Integration testing in Spring Framework is important to test the correct wiring of Spring IoC container contexts, data access using JDBC or an ORM tool, and the correctness of SQL statements, Hibernate queries, JPA entity mappings, and so forth. It does not rely on an application server or other deployment environment and provides a slower but faster alternative to Selenium tests or remote tests that rely on deployment to an application server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/integration.html)"
"What is the Spring TestContext Framework and what are its goals?","The Spring TestContext Framework is a testing framework that provides consistent loading of Spring ApplicationContext instances and WebApplicationContext instances, caching of those contexts, Dependency Injection of test fixture instances, transaction management appropriate to integration testing, and support classes for integration testing.

"What is the main goal of the Spring TestContext Framework?","The main goal of the Spring TestContext Framework is to provide generic, annotation-driven unit and integration testing support that is agnostic of the testing framework in use. It also emphasizes convention over configuration, with reasonable defaults that can be overridden through annotation-based configuration. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework.html>)"
"What are the key abstractions in the Spring TestContext Framework?","The key abstractions in the Spring TestContext Framework include the TestContext, TestExecutionListener, and TestExecutionEvent. The TestContext represents the execution context of a test. TestExecutionListeners are responsible for performing various tasks during the test lifecycle. TestExecutionEvents are fired during the test lifecycle and can be listened for by TestExecutionListeners. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework.html>)"
"What is the main entry point into the Spring TestContext Framework and what is its responsibility?","The main entry point into the Spring TestContext Framework is the TestContextManager class, which is responsible for managing a single TestContext and signaling events to each registered TestExecutionListener at well-defined test execution points. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/key-abstractions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TestContext class in the Spring TestContext Framework?","The TestContext class encapsulates the context in which a test is run and provides context management and caching support for the test instance for which it is responsible.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/bootstrapping.html)"
"When is the DefaultTestContextBootstrapper used instead of the WebTestContextBootstrapper?","The DefaultTestContextBootstrapper is used when the @WebAppConfiguration annotation is not present. The WebTestContextBootstrapper is used when the @WebAppConfiguration annotation is present. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/bootstrapping.html)"
"What is the recommended approach for implementing the TestContextBootstrapper interface?","It is recommended to extend the AbstractTestContextBootstrapper or one of its concrete subclasses instead of implementing the TestContextBootstrapper interface directly, as the SPI is likely to change in the future. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/bootstrapping.html)"
"What is the order in which TestExecutionListener implementations are registered by default in Spring Boot?","The default order is: ServletTestExecutionListener, DirtiesContextBeforeModesTestExecutionListener, ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener, DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener, MicrometerObservationRegistryTestExecutionListener, DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener, TransactionalTestExecutionListener, SqlScriptsTestExecutionListener, EventPublishingTestExecutionListener. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/tel-config.html)"
"How can I register TestExecutionListener implementations explicitly for a test class in Spring Boot?","You can use the @TestExecutionListeners annotation to register TestExecutionListener implementations explicitly for a test class, its subclasses, and its nested classes. See the javadoc for @TestExecutionListeners for details and examples. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/tel-config.html)"
"How can I switch to the default set of TestExecutionListener implementations if I extend a class annotated with @TestExecutionListeners in Spring Boot?","You can annotate your class with @TestExecutionListeners( listeners = {}, inheritListeners = false, mergeMode = MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS) to switch to the default set of listeners. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/tel-config.html)"
"How can you record application events in Spring Framework 5.3.3?","You can record application events in Spring Framework 5.3.3 by annotating or meta-annotating your test class with @RecordApplicationEvents and ensuring that the ApplicationEventsTestExecutionListener is registered. You can also annotate a field of type ApplicationEvents with @Autowired and use that instance of ApplicationEvents in your test and lifecycle methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/application-events.html)"
"How can you process the recorded application events in a test?","You can process the recorded application events in a test using the ApplicationEvents API, which allows you to access the events as a java.util.Stream. You can then use this stream to perform assertions or other operations on the events. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/application-events.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Autowired annotation when used with ApplicationEvents?","The @Autowired annotation is used to inject the ApplicationEvents instance for the current test. This instance can then be used to access the recorded application events in the test and lifecycle methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/application-events.html)"
"What is the EventPublishingTestExecutionListener and what does it offer?","The EventPublishingTestExecutionListener is an alternative approach to implementing a custom TestExecutionListener. It offers a way for components in the test's ApplicationContext to listen to events published by the listener, which corresponds to methods in the TestExecutionListener API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/test-execution-events.html)"
"What are the advantages of consuming test execution events rather than implementing a custom TestExecutionListener?","Consuming test execution events allows beans to benefit directly from dependency injection and other features of the ApplicationContext. In contrast, a TestExecutionListener is not a bean in the ApplicationContext. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/test-execution-events.html)"
"How can a Spring bean listen to test execution events?","A Spring bean can choose to implement the org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener interface or use the @EventListener annotation to listen to one of the particular event types listed in the documentation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/test-execution-events.html)"
"How does a test instance access the configured ApplicationContext in Spring Boot?","A test instance can access the configured ApplicationContext by implementing the ApplicationContextAware interface or injecting the application context through the @Autowired annotation on either a field or setter method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @ContextConfiguration annotation in Spring Boot testing?","The @ContextConfiguration annotation is used to configure a test ApplicationContext by specifying XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, component classes, or context initializers.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management.html)"
"How can I load an ApplicationContext for my tests using Groovy scripts in Spring Boot?","You can annotate your test class with @ContextConfiguration and configure the locations or value attribute with an array that contains the resource locations of Groovy scripts. Resource lookup semantics for Groovy scripts are the same as those described for XML configuration files. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/groovy.html)"
"How can I specify the location of Groovy configuration files in my test class?","You can specify the location of Groovy configuration files by using the locations or value attribute of the @ContextConfiguration annotation. The following example shows how to specify Groovy configuration files: Java Kotlin @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from ""/AppConfig.groovy"" and // ""/TestConfig.groovy"" in the root of the classpath @ContextConfiguration({""/AppConfig.groovy"", ""/TestConfig.Groovy""}) class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Specifying the location of Groovy configuration files. @ExtendWith(SpringExtension::class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from ""/AppConfig.groovy"" and // ""/TestConfig.groovy"" in the root of the classpath @ContextConfiguration(""/AppConfig.groovy"", ""/TestConfig.Groovy"") class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Specifying the location of Groovy configuration files. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/groovy.html)"
"How can I load configuration from the default location in my test class?","If you omit both the locations and value attributes from the @ContextConfiguration annotation, the TestContext framework tries to detect a default Groovy script. Specifically, GenericGroovyXmlContextLoader and GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader detect a default location based on the name of the test class. If your class is named com.example.MyTest, the Groovy context loader loads your application context from ""classpath:com/example/MyTestContext.groovy"". The following example shows how to use the default: Java Kotlin @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from // ""classpath:com/example/MyTestContext.groovy"" @ContextConfiguration class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Loading configuration from the default location. @ExtendWith(SpringExtension::class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from // ""classpath:com/example/MyTestContext.groovy"" @ContextConfiguration class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Loading configuration from the default location. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/groovy.html)"
"How can you load an ApplicationContext for your tests using component classes?","You can annotate your test class with @ContextConfiguration and configure the classes attribute with an array that contains references to component classes. The following example shows how to do so: Java Kotlin @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from AppConfig and TestConfig @ContextConfiguration(classes = {AppConfig.class, TestConfig.class}) (1) class MyTest { // class body... } 1 Specifying component classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/javaconfig.html)"
"What is meant by the term 'component class' in the context of Spring Boot?","A component class can refer to any of the following: A class annotated with @Configuration, a component (that is, a class annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or other stereotype annotations), a JSR-330 compliant class that is annotated with jakarta.inject annotations, any class that contains @Bean-methods, or any other class that is intended to be registered as a Spring component (i.e., a Spring bean in the ApplicationContext), potentially taking advantage of automatic autowiring of a single constructor without the use of Spring annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/javaconfig.html)"
"How can you load configuration information from a static nested configuration class in a test class?","In the following example, the OrderServiceTest class declares a static nested configuration class named Config that is automatically used to load the ApplicationContext for the test class: Java Kotlin @SpringJUnitConfig (1) // ApplicationContext will be loaded from the static nested Config class class OrderServiceTest { @Configuration static class Config { // this bean will be injected into the OrderServiceTest class @Bean OrderService orderService() { OrderService orderService = new OrderServiceImpl(); // set properties, etc. return orderService; } } @Autowired OrderService orderService; @Test void testOrderService() { // test the orderService } } 1 Loading configuration information from the nested Config class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/javaconfig.html)"
"Can you mix XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, and component classes to configure an ApplicationContext for tests?","Yes, it is possible to mix XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, and component classes (typically @Configuration classes) to configure an ApplicationContext for your tests. Some third-party frameworks, such as Spring Boot, provide first-class support for loading an ApplicationContext from different types of resources simultaneously. However, most of the SmartContextLoader implementations in the spring-test module support only one resource type for each test context. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/mixed-config.html)"
"How can you use both resource locations (e.g., XML or Groovy) and @Configuration classes to configure your tests?","To use both resource locations (e.g., XML or Groovy) and @Configuration classes to configure your tests, you must pick one as the entry point, and that one must include or import the other. In XML or Groovy scripts, you can include @Configuration classes by using component scanning or defining them as normal Spring beans. In a @Configuration class, you can use @ImportResource to import XML configuration files or Groovy scripts. This behavior is semantically equivalent to how you configure your application in production. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/mixed-config.html)"
"What are the exceptions to the general rule of using only one resource type for each test context in the Spring Framework?","The GenericGroovyXmlContextLoader and GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader support both XML configuration files and Groovy scripts simultaneously.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/initializers.html)"
"Can you specify configuration by using only an initializer in the @ContextConfiguration annotation?","Yes, you can omit the declaration of XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, or component classes in @ContextConfiguration and instead declare only ApplicationContextInitializer classes, which are responsible for registering beans in the context. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/initializers.html)"
"What are the two attributes supported by @ContextConfiguration in Spring Boot that denote whether resource locations or component classes and context initializers declared by superclasses should be inherited?","The two attributes are inheritLocations and inheritInitializers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/inheritance.html)"
"What is the default value for both the inheritLocations and inheritInitializers attributes in @ContextConfiguration?","The default value for both flags is true. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/inheritance.html)"
"How does a test class inherit resource locations or component classes as well as the context initializers declared by any superclasses in Spring Boot?","The resource locations or component classes for a test class are appended to the list of resource locations or annotated classes declared by superclasses. The initializers for a given test class are added to the set of initializers defined by test superclasses. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/inheritance.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @TestPropertySource annotation in Spring Framework?","The purpose of the @TestPropertySource annotation in Spring Framework is to declare resource locations for test properties files or inlined properties, which are added to the set of PropertySources in the Environment for the ApplicationContext loaded for the annotated integration test. This allows for configuration of integration tests with test-specific property sources.

"How can you configure test properties files using the @TestPropertySource annotation?","To configure test properties files using the @TestPropertySource annotation, you can use the locations or value attribute of @TestPropertySource. By default, both traditional and XML-based java.util.Properties file formats are supported. For example, you can use 'classpath:/com/example/test.properties' or 'file:///path/to/file.xml'. You can also use a plain path (for example, 'test.properties') which is treated as a classpath resource relative to the package in which the test class is defined. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/property-sources.html)"
"How can you configure inlined properties in the @TestPropertySource annotation?","To configure inlined properties in the @TestPropertySource annotation, you can use the properties attribute of @TestPropertySource. All key-value pairs are added to the enclosing Environment as a single test PropertySource with the highest precedence. The supported syntax for key-value pairs is the same as the syntax defined for entries in a Java properties file: key=value, key:value, or key value. As of Spring Framework 6.1, you can use text blocks to define multiple inlined properties in a single String.

"How is the DynamicPropertyRegistry argument used in the @DynamicPropertySource annotation?","The DynamicPropertyRegistry argument is used to add name-value pairs to the Environment. Values are dynamic and provided via a Supplier which is only invoked when the property is resolved. Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/dynamic-property-sources.html"
"How can you instruct the TestContext framework to load a WebApplicationContext instead of a standard ApplicationContext for integration tests?","You can annotate the respective test class with @WebAppConfiguration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/web.html)"
"What is the default base resource path for the MockServletContext when using @WebAppConfiguration?","The default base resource path for the MockServletContext is set to src/main/webapp. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/web.html)"
"Can you use XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, or @Configuration classes when testing with a WebApplicationContext?","Yes, you can declare XML configuration files, Groovy scripts, or @Configuration classes by using @ContextConfiguration when testing with a WebApplicationContext. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/web.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ServletTestExecutionListener in the TestContext framework?","The ServletTestExecutionListener is responsible for setting up default thread-local state and creating MockHttpServletRequest, MockHttpServletResponse, and ServletWebRequest based on the base resource path configured with @WebAppConfiguration. It also ensures that these mocks can be injected into the test instance and cleans up thread-local state after the test is complete.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/web-mocks.html)"
"How does Spring TestContext framework cache ApplicationContexts for tests?","The TestContext framework caches ApplicationContexts (or WebApplicationContexts) for tests by generating a unique key based on the combination of configuration parameters used to load the context. This key is used to store the context in a static cache. If subsequent tests in the same test suite have the same unique combination of configuration parameters, they share the same ApplicationContext, reducing setup time. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.html)"
"What are the factors that determine whether two tests share the same ApplicationContext in the TestContext framework?","Two tests in the same test suite will share the same ApplicationContext if they have the same unique combination of configuration parameters, including locations, classes, contextInitializerClasses, contextCustomizers, contextLoader, parent, activeProfiles, propertySourceDescriptors, propertySourceProperties, and resourceBasePath. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.html)"
"How can I ensure that all tests in a suite run within the same process to benefit from ApplicationContext caching?","To ensure that all tests run within the same process and benefit from ApplicationContext caching, you can execute all tests as a group within an IDE or configure your build framework, such as Ant, Maven, or Gradle, to not fork between tests. For example, in Maven, you should not set the forkMode for the Surefire plug-in to always or pertest. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.html)"
"What is the purpose of the context failure threshold policy in Spring Framework 6.1?","The context failure threshold policy in Spring Framework 6.1 helps avoid repeated attempts to load a failing ApplicationContext. This prevents individual test classes and test suites from taking longer to fail when a configuration error or missing external resource prevents the context from loading. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html)"
"By default, how many attempts are made to load an ApplicationContext for a given context cache key?","By default, only one attempt is made to load an ApplicationContext for a given context cache key. Any subsequent attempt to load the ApplicationContext for the same context cache key will result in an immediate IllegalStateException. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html)"
"How can you configure the context failure threshold in Spring Framework 6.1?","You can configure the context failure threshold from the command line or a build script by setting a JVM system property named spring.test.context.failure.threshold with a positive integer value. Alternatively, you can set the same property via the SpringProperties mechanism. To effectively disable the context failure threshold, you can set the property to a very large value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/failure-threshold.html)"
"What is the purpose of using a context hierarchy in Spring integration tests?","The purpose of using a context hierarchy in Spring integration tests is to test against a hierarchy of ApplicationContext instances. This is beneficial or necessary when developing a Spring MVC web application or Spring Batch applications, where shared components and infrastructure configuration are declared in the root context and consumed in the child context by web-specific components. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/hierarchies.html)"
"How can you declare a context hierarchy in a single test class?","You can declare a context hierarchy in a single test class by using the @ContextHierarchy annotation, either on an individual test class or within a test class hierarchy. This allows you to test against a hierarchy of ApplicationContext instances. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/hierarchies.html)"
"How can you merge or override the context configuration for a specific, named level in the context hierarchy?","To merge or override the context configuration for a specific, named level in the context hierarchy, you can use the name attribute in @ContextConfiguration. This allows you to merge or override the context configuration for a given level in the hierarchy, ensuring that the configuration resource type (XML configuration files or component classes) is consistent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/hierarchies.html)"
"What is the purpose of the DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener in Spring Boot?","The DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener is responsible for injecting dependencies of test instances from beans in the application context. This is configured by default and supports setter injection, field injection, and constructor injection for JUnit Jupiter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.html)"
"How can you use field injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot?","To use field injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot, you can annotate the field with @Autowired or @Inject. This approach is encouraged in test code as you will never instantiate your test class directly. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.html)"
"How can you use setter injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot?","To use setter injection for dependency injection in test code using Spring Boot, you can annotate the setter method with @Autowired or @Inject. This approach is also supported and allows you to inject dependencies into your test instances. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/fixture-di.html)"
"How can I ensure a WebApplicationContext is loaded for my test in Spring?","You can annotate your test class with @WebAppConfiguration to ensure a WebApplicationContext is loaded for your test. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/web-scoped-beans.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TestContext framework in Spring?","The TestContext framework in Spring provides support for testing web-scoped beans such as request- and session-scoped beans. It allows you to configure request and session parameters through mocks. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/web-scoped-beans.html)"
"How can I inject a mock request or session into my test instance in Spring?","You can inject the mock request or session into your test instance by using dependency injection. This allows you to prepare your test fixture and invoke your web component. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/web-scoped-beans.html)"
"How are transactions managed in the TestContext framework?","Transactions are managed by the TransactionalTestExecutionListener, which is configured by default even if you do not explicitly declare @TestExecutionListeners on your test class. To enable support for transactions, you must configure a PlatformTransactionManager bean in the ApplicationContext that is loaded with @ContextConfiguration semantics. In addition, you must declare Spring’s @Transactional annotation either at the class or the method level for your tests."
"What are test-managed transactions and how do they differ from Spring-managed and application-managed transactions?","Test-managed transactions are transactions that are managed declaratively by using the TransactionalTestExecutionListener or programmatically by using TestTransaction. They differ from Spring-managed and application-managed transactions in that they participate in test-managed transactions. However, caution must be taken if Spring-managed or application-managed transactions are configured with any propagation type other than REQUIRED or SUPPORTS."
"How can you enable and disable transactions in the TestContext framework?","Transactions can be enabled by annotating a test method with @Transactional. If a test class is annotated with @Transactional, each test method within that class hierarchy runs within a transaction. Test methods that are not annotated with @Transactional are not run within a transaction. Note that @Transactional is not supported on test lifecycle methods and tests that are annotated with @Transactional but have the propagation attribute set to NOT_SUPPORTED or NEVER are not run within a transaction."
"How can you initialize an embedded or existing database by executing SQL scripts in Spring?","You can use the spring-jdbc module, which provides support for initializing a database by executing SQL scripts when the Spring ApplicationContext is loaded. See Embedded database support(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/reference/html/data-access.html#data-access-jdbc-embedded-database-support) and Testing data access logic with an embedded database(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/reference/html/data-access.html#data-access-jdbc-embedded-database-support-dao-testing) for details."
"What are the options for executing SQL scripts programmatically within integration test methods in Spring?","Spring provides the following options: org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init.ScriptUtils, org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init.ResourceDatabasePopulator, org.springframework.test.context.junit4.AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests, and org.springframework.test.context.testng.AbstractTransactionalTestNGSpringContextTests. ScriptUtils provides a collection of static utility methods for working with SQL scripts and is mainly intended for internal use within the framework. ResourceDatabasePopulator provides an object-based API for programmatically populating, initializing, or cleaning up a database by using SQL scripts defined in external resources. The executeSqlScript(..) methods in AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests and AbstractTransactionalTestNGSpringContextTests internally use a ResourceDatabasePopulator to run SQL scripts. See the Javadoc for the various executeSqlScript(..) methods for further details."
"How can you declaratively configure SQL scripts in the Spring TestContext Framework?","You can declare the @Sql annotation on a test class or test method to configure individual SQL statements or the resource paths to SQL scripts that should be run against a given database before or after an integration test class or test method. Support for @Sql is provided by the SqlScriptsTestExecutionListener, which is enabled by default. Method-level @Sql declarations override class-level declarations by default, but this behavior may be configured per test class or per test method via @SqlMergeMode. See Merging and Overriding Configuration with @SqlMergeMode(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/reference/html/testcontext-framework.html#testcontext-executing-sql-declaratively-script-merging) for further details."

"What are the general guidelines for when not to run tests in parallel in Spring Framework?","Do not run tests in parallel if they use @DirtiesContext, @MockBean or @SpyBean, @FixMethodOrder, or change the state of shared services or systems. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/parallel-test-execution.html)"
"What is the maximum size of the ContextCache and how can it be increased?","The maximum size of the ContextCache is not specified in the given information. To increase the maximum size of the cache, you can adjust the configuration settings for your testing framework, build tool, or IDE. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/parallel-test-execution.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring TestContext Framework, and how does it integrate with JUnit 4?","The Spring TestContext Framework offers full integration with JUnit 4 through a custom runner (supported on JUnit 4.12 or higher). By annotating test classes with @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) or the shorter @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) variant, developers can implement standard JUnit 4-based unit and integration tests and simultaneously reap the benefits of the TestContext framework, such as support for loading application contexts, dependency injection of test instances, transactional test method execution, and so on. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.html)"
"What are the advantages of using Spring's rule-based JUnit support instead of the SpringRunner?","Spring’s rule-based JUnit support has the advantage of being independent of any org.junit.runner.Runner implementation and can, therefore, be combined with existing alternative runners (such as JUnit 4’s Parameterized ) or third-party runners (such as the MockitoJUnitRunner ). To support the full functionality of the TestContext framework, you must combine a SpringClassRule with a SpringMethodRule. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.html)"
"How does the SpringExtension for JUnit Jupiter provide integration with the JUnit Jupiter testing framework?","By annotating test classes with @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class), you can implement standard JUnit Jupiter-based unit and integration tests and simultaneously reap the benefits of the TestContext framework, such as support for loading application contexts, dependency injection of test instances, transactional test method execution, and so on. Furthermore, thanks to the rich extension API in JUnit Jupiter, Spring provides the following features above and beyond the feature set that Spring supports for JUnit 4 and TestNG: Dependency injection for test constructors, test methods, and test lifecycle callback methods. Powerful support for conditional test execution based on SpEL expressions, environment variables, system properties, and so on. Custom composed annotations that combine annotations from Spring and JUnit Jupiter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/support-classes.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's Ahead of Time (AOT) support for integration tests?","The purpose of Spring's Ahead of Time (AOT) support for integration tests is to provide build-time detection of all integration tests in the current project that use the TestContext framework to load an ApplicationContext. It also extends Spring's core AOT support with features like explicit support for test classes based on JUnit Jupiter and JUnit 4, as well as implicit support for TestNG and other testing frameworks that use Spring's core testing annotations. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/aot.html>)"
"What are the build-time and runtime AOT support features in Spring's AOT support for integration tests?","The build-time AOT support feature in Spring's AOT support for integration tests is that each unique test ApplicationContext in the current project will be refreshed for AOT processing. The runtime AOT support feature is that when executing in AOT runtime mode, a Spring integration test will use an AOT-optimized ApplicationContext that participates transparently with the context cache. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/aot.html>)"
"How can you disable an entire test class or individual test method in AOT mode?","You can selectively disable an entire test class or individual test method in AOT mode by annotating it with @DisabledInAotMode. When using JUnit Jupiter, you may selectively enable or disable tests in a GraalVM native image via Jupiter’s @EnabledInNativeImage and @DisabledInNativeImage annotations. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/testcontext-framework/aot.html>)"
"What is MockMvc and what is its purpose in testing Spring MVC applications?","MockMvc is a Spring MVC Test framework that provides support for testing Spring MVC applications. It performs full Spring MVC request handling but via mock request and response objects instead of a running server. Its purpose is to allow developers to test their Spring MVC applications without the need for a running server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework.html)"
"How can MockMvc be used in testing Spring MVC applications?","MockMvc can be used on its own to perform requests and verify responses. It can also be used through the WebTestClient, where MockMvc is plugged in as the server to handle requests with. The advantage of WebTestClient is the option to work with higher level objects instead of raw data as well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests against a live server and use the same test API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework.html)"
"What are some advantages of using WebTestClient over MockMvc in testing Spring MVC applications?","The advantage of WebTestClient is the option to work with higher level objects instead of raw data as well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP tests against a live server and use the same test API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Spring MVC Test framework?","The Spring MVC Test framework, also known as MockMvc, aims to provide more complete testing for Spring MVC controllers without a running server. It does that by invoking the DispatcherServlet and passing ‘mock’ implementations of the Servlet API(../unit.html#mock-objects-servlet) from the spring-test module which replicates the full Spring MVC request handling without a running server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server.html)"
"What are the limitations of plain unit tests for Spring MVC?","Plain unit tests for Spring MVC do not verify request mappings, data binding, message conversion, type conversion, validation, and nor do they involve any of the supporting @InitBinder, @ModelAttribute, or @ExceptionHandler methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server.html)"
"How can you use MockMvc in your tests?","You can use MockMvc on its own to perform requests and to verify responses, or you can also use it through the WebTestClient(../webtestclient.html) API with MockMvc plugged in as the server to handle requests with. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server.html)"
"What are static imports and when do you need them in MockMvc?","Static imports are used to import static methods or classes from a specific class. You'll need static imports for MockMvcBuilders, MockMvcRequestBuilders, MockMvcResultMatchers, and MockMvcResultHandlers when using MockMvc directly to perform requests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-static-imports.html)"
"How can you remember the static imports for MockMvc?","An easy way to remember the static imports for MockMvc is to search for MockMvc*. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-static-imports.html)"
"Do you need static imports when using the WebTestClient with MockMvc?","No, you do not need static imports when using the WebTestClient with MockMvc as it provides a fluent API without static imports. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-static-imports.html)"
"What are the two ways to setup MockMvc for testing in Spring MVC?","The two ways to setup MockMvc for testing in Spring MVC are: 1) Pointing directly to the controllers you want to test and programmatically configuring Spring MVC infrastructure using MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(). 2) Pointing to Spring configuration with Spring MVC and controller infrastructure in it using MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-setup-options.html)"
"How can you inject mock services into controllers when setting up MockMvc through Spring configuration?","You can inject mock services into controllers when setting up MockMvc through Spring configuration by declaring a mock service with Mockito using a <bean> tag in your Spring configuration XML file. Then, you can autowire the mock service into your test class and use it to set up and verify expectations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-setup-options.html)"
"What is the difference between using standaloneSetup and webAppContextSetup for MockMvc setup in terms of testing focus and Spring MVC configuration verification?","The standaloneSetup is a little closer to a unit test, testing one controller at a time and not involving the loading of Spring configuration. This setup is more focused on style and makes it easier to see which controller is being tested, whether any specific Spring MVC configuration is required to work, and so on. On the other hand, the webAppContextSetup loads your actual Spring MVC configuration, resulting in a more complete integration test. Using the webAppContextSetup helps keep tests running fast, even as you introduce more tests in your test suite, and allows you to inject mock services into controllers through Spring configuration to remain focused on testing the web layer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-setup-options.html)"
"How can I perform file upload requests using MockMvc?","To perform file upload requests using MockMvc, you can use the multipart() method, which internally uses MockMultipartHttpServletRequest. This allows you to set up the request in a similar way to the following example: mockMvc.perform(multipart(""/doc"").file(""a1"", ""ABC"".getBytes(""UTF-8""))); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-performing-requests.html)"
"How can I specify query parameters in a request using MockMvc?","To specify query parameters in a request using MockMvc, you can use URI template style in the request URI.

"What is the purpose of the Async Requests section in the Spring Boot documentation?","The Async Requests section in the Spring Boot documentation shows how to use MockMvc to test asynchronous request handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/async-requests.html)"
"How do asynchronous requests work in Spring MVC?","In Spring MVC, asynchronous requests work by exiting the Servlet container thread and allowing the application to compute the response asynchronously, after which an async dispatch is made to complete processing on a Servlet container thread. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/async-requests.html)"
"How can async requests be tested in Spring MVC Test?","In Spring MVC Test, async requests can be tested by asserting the produced async value first, then manually performing the async dispatch, and finally verifying the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/async-requests.html)"
"Can MockMvcWebTestClient handle testing infinite streams?","No, MockMvcWebTestClient does not support infinite streams because there is no way to cancel the server stream from the client side.

"How can we initialize a Geb Browser with a Selenium WebDriver that uses MockMvc?","We can easily initialize a Geb Browser with a Selenium WebDriver that uses MockMvc by using the MockMvcHtmlUnitDriverBuilder as follows: def setup() { browser.driver = MockMvcHtmlUnitDriverBuilder .webAppContextSetup(context) .build() } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-htmlunit/geb.html)"
"How can we use the Page Object Pattern with Geb to test our application?","We can use the Page Object Pattern with Geb by extending the Page class and defining a URL, an at closure, and a content closure for each page. This allows us to navigate to the page, verify that we are on the correct page, and select the content in which we are interested using a jQuery-ish Navigator API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/spring-mvc-test-framework/server-htmlunit/geb.html)"
"How can I test client-side code that uses the RestTemplate in Spring Boot?","You can use client-side tests to test code that internally uses the RestTemplate. The idea is to declare expected requests and to provide ‘stub’ responses so that you can focus on testing the code in isolation (that is, without running a server). The following example shows how to do so: Java Kotlin RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build(); mockServer.expect(requestTo('/greeting')).andRespond(withSuccess()); // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify(); val restTemplate = RestTemplate() val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build() mockServer.expect(requestTo('/greeting')).andRespond(withSuccess()) // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify() In the preceding example, MockRestServiceServer (the central class for client-side REST tests) configures the RestTemplate with a custom ClientHttpRequestFactory that asserts actual requests against expectations and returns ‘stub’ responses. In this case, we expect a request to /greeting and want to return a 200 response with text/plain content. We can define additional expected requests and stub responses as needed. When we define expected requests and stub responses, the RestTemplate can be used in client-side code as usual. At the end of testing, mockServer.verify() can be used to verify that all expectations have been satisfied. By default, requests are expected in the order in which expectations were declared. You can set the ignoreExpectOrder option when building the server, in which case all expectations are checked (in order) to find a match for a given request. That means requests are allowed to come in any order. The following example uses ignoreExpectOrder : Java Kotlin server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).ignoreExpectOrder(true).build(); server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).ignoreExpectOrder(true).build() Even with unordered requests by default, each request is allowed to run once only. The expect method provides an overloaded variant that accepts an ExpectedCount argument that specifies a count range (for example, once , manyTimes , max , min , between , and so on). The following example uses times : Java Kotlin RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build(); mockServer.expect(times(2), requestTo('/something')).andRespond(withSuccess()); mockServer.expect(times(3), requestTo('/somewhere')).andRespond(withSuccess()); // ... mockServer.verify(); val restTemplate = RestTemplate() val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build() mockServer.expect(times(2), requestTo('/something')).andRespond(withSuccess()) mockServer.expect(times(3), requestTo('/somewhere')).andRespond(withSuccess()) // ... mockServer.verify() Note that, when ignoreExpectOrder is not set (the default), and, therefore, requests are expected in order of declaration, then that order applies only to the first of any expected request. For example if '/something' is expected two times followed by '/somewhere' three times, then there should be a request to '/something' before there is a request to '/somewhere', but, aside from that subsequent '/something' and '/somewhere', requests can come at any time. As an alternative to all of the above, the client-side test support also provides a ClientHttpRequestFactory implementation that you can configure into a RestTemplate to bind it to a MockMvc instance. That allows processing requests using actual server-side logic but without running a server. The following example shows how to do so: Java Kotlin MockMvc mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.wac).build(); this.restTemplate = new RestTemplate(new MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory(mockMvc)); // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... val mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.wac).build() restTemplate = RestTemplate(MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory(mockMvc)) // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... In some cases it may be necessary to perform an actual call to a remote service instead of mocking the response. The following example shows how to do that through ExecutingResponseCreator : Java Kotlin RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); // Create ExecutingResponseCreator with the original request factory ExecutingResponseCreator withActualResponse = new ExecutingResponseCreator(restTemplate.getRequestFactory()); MockRestServiceServer mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build(); mockServer.expect(requestTo('/profile')).andRespond(withSuccess()); mockServer.expect(requestTo('/quoteOfTheDay')).andRespond(withActualResponse); // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify(); val restTemplate = RestTemplate() // Create ExecutingResponseCreator with the original request factory val withActualResponse = new ExecutingResponseCreator(restTemplate.getRequestFactory()) val mockServer = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build() mockServer.expect(requestTo('/profile')).andRespond(withSuccess()) mockServer.expect(requestTo('/quoteOfTheDay')).andRespond(withActualResponse) // Test code that uses the above RestTemplate ... mockServer.verify() In the preceding example, we create the ExecutingResponseCreator using the ClientHttpRequestFactory from the RestTemplate before MockRestServiceServer replaces it with a different one that mocks responses. Then we define expectations with two kinds of responses: a stub 200 response for the /profile endpoint (no actual request will be executed) a response obtained through a call to the /quoteOfTheDay endpoint In the second case, the request is executed through the ClientHttpRequestFactory that was captured earlier. This generates a response that could e.g. come from an actual remote server, depending on how the RestTemplate was originally configured. Static Imports: As with server-side tests, the fluent API for client-side tests requires a few static imports. Those are easy to find by searching for MockRest* . Eclipse users should add MockRestRequestMatchers.* and MockRestResponseCreators.* as “favorite static members” in the Eclipse preferences under Java → Editor → Content Assist → Favorites. That allows using content assist after typing the first character of the static method name. Other IDEs (such IntelliJ) may not require any additional configuration. Check for the support for code completion on static members. Further Examples of Client-side REST Tests: Spring MVC Test’s own tests include example tests(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/web/client/samples) of client-side REST tests.

"What is the purpose of the @TestConstructor annotation in Spring Boot testing?","@TestConstructor is a type-level annotation that is used to configure how the parameters of a test class constructor are autowired from components in the test's ApplicationContext. If @TestConstructor is not present or meta-present on a test class, the default test constructor autowire mode will be used. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-junit-jupiter.html)"
"What is the purpose of using meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing?","The purpose of using meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing is to create custom composed annotations and reduce configuration duplication across a test suite. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-meta.html)"
"Which test-related annotations can be used as meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing?","Most test-related annotations can be used as meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing, including @BootstrapWith, @ContextConfiguration, @ContextHierarchy, @ContextCustomizerFactories, @ActiveProfiles, @TestPropertySource, @DirtiesContext, @WebAppConfiguration, @TestExecutionListeners, @Transactional, @BeforeTransaction, @AfterTransaction, @Commit, @Rollback, @Sql, @SqlConfig, @SqlMergeMode, @SqlGroup, @Repeat (only supported on JUnit 4), @Timed (only supported on JUnit 4), @IfProfileValue (only supported on JUnit 4), @ProfileValueSourceConfiguration (only supported on JUnit 4), @SpringJUnitConfig (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @SpringJUnitWebConfig (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @TestConstructor (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @NestedTestConfiguration (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), @EnabledIf (only supported on JUnit Jupiter), and @DisabledIf (only supported on JUnit Jupiter). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-meta.html)"
"How can you simplify the configuration of individual test classes using meta-annotations in Spring Boot testing?","You can simplify the configuration of individual test classes using meta-annotations by introducing a custom composed annotation that centralizes the common test configuration for Spring or Spring and JUnit Jupiter. This custom annotation can then be used to simplify the configuration of individual test classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing/annotations/integration-meta.html)"
"What is JUnit and what are its key features?","JUnit is a programmer-friendly testing framework for Java and the JVM.

"What is the purpose of the 'DAO Support' section in the 'Data Access' section?","The 'DAO Support' section in the 'Data Access' section provides support for the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access.html)"
"What are the benefits of using the Spring Framework's transaction management?","The Spring Framework provides a consistent abstraction for transaction management that delivers the following benefits: A consistent programming model across different transaction APIs, support for declarative transaction management, a simpler API for programmatic transaction management, and excellent integration with Spring's data access abstractions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html)"
"How can the Spring Framework's transaction abstraction be configured and obtained?","The Spring Framework transaction abstraction can be configured and obtained by understanding the core classes and describing how to configure and obtain DataSource instances from a variety of sources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html)"
"What are the different types of transaction management supported by the Spring Framework?","The Spring Framework supports both declarative and programmatic transaction management. Declarative transaction management allows transactions to be defined using annotations or XML configurations, while programmatic transaction management involves explicitly coding transactions within the application code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html)"
"What are the two traditional choices for transaction management in EE application development?","The two traditional choices for transaction management in EE application development are global transactions and local transactions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/motivation.html)"
"What are the limitations of global transactions and how does the Spring Framework address them?","Global transactions have limitations such as being cumbersome to use, requiring JNDI lookups, and limiting reusability of application code. The Spring Framework addresses these limitations by providing a consistent programming model that allows developers to use declarative or programmatic transaction management and change the transaction management strategy without changing the code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/motivation.html)"
"What are the disadvantages of local transactions and how does the Spring Framework improve upon them?","Local transactions are resource-specific and cannot work across multiple transactional resources, making them less flexible. The Spring Framework improves upon this by providing a consistent programming model that allows developers to use declarative transaction management and change the transaction management strategy without changing the code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/motivation.html)"
"What is the key to the Spring transaction abstraction?","The key to the Spring transaction abstraction is the notion of a transaction strategy. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/strategies.html)"
"What is the difference between a PlatformTransactionManager and a ReactiveTransactionManager?","The PlatformTransactionManager is for imperative transaction management, while the ReactiveTransactionManager is for reactive transaction management. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/strategies.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TransactionDefinition interface in Spring Framework?","The TransactionDefinition interface specifies properties such as propagation, isolation, timeout, and read-only status for a transaction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/strategies.html)"
"What is the preferred approach to ensure proper handling of resources in Spring's persistence integration APIs?","The preferred approach is to use Spring’s highest-level template-based persistence integration APIs or to use native ORM APIs with transaction-aware factory beans or proxies for managing the native resource factories. These transaction-aware solutions internally handle resource creation and reuse, cleanup, optional transaction synchronization of the resources, and exception mapping. Thus, user data access code does not have to address these tasks but can focus purely on non-boilerplate persistence logic. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-resource-synchronization.html)"
"What is the low-level synchronization approach in Spring's persistence integration APIs?","At a lower level, classes such as DataSourceUtils (for JDBC), EntityManagerFactoryUtils (for JPA), SessionFactoryUtils (for Hibernate), and so on exist. When you want the application code to deal directly with the resource types of the native persistence APIs, you use these classes to ensure that proper Spring Framework-managed instances are obtained, transactions are (optionally) synchronized, and exceptions that occur in the process are properly mapped to a consistent API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-resource-synchronization.html)"
"What is the TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy class in Spring's persistence integration APIs?","The TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy class is a proxy for a target DataSource , which wraps the target DataSource to add awareness of Spring-managed transactions. It is similar to a transactional JNDI DataSource , as provided by a Jakarta EE server. You should almost never need or want to use this class, except when existing code must be called and passed a standard JDBC DataSource interface implementation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-resource-synchronization.html)"
"What is the main advantage of using declarative transaction management in Spring Boot compared to programmatic transaction management?","The main advantage of using declarative transaction management in Spring Boot compared to programmatic transaction management is that it has the least impact on application code and is most consistent with the ideals of a non-invasive lightweight container. This means that less changes are required in the application code to manage transactions, making it more straightforward and less prone to errors. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative.html)"
"Can you explain the concept of 'rollback rules' in Spring Boot's declarative transaction management?","In Spring Boot's declarative transaction management, 'rollback rules' allow you to specify which exceptions or throwables should cause automatic rollback of a transaction. This means that you can define certain exceptions that, when thrown, will automatically roll back the transaction without the need for additional code. This feature is unique to Spring Boot and is not available in EJB CMT. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative.html)"
"How does Spring Boot's declarative transaction management differ from EJB CMT in terms of transactional behavior customization?","Spring Boot's declarative transaction management allows for more customization of transactional behavior compared to EJB CMT. In Spring Boot, you can use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to insert custom behavior in the case of transaction rollback, add arbitrary advice along with transactional advice, and customize transactional behavior. In contrast, EJB CMT does not allow for any customization of transaction management, and you can only use the setRollbackOnly() method to influence the container's transaction management. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative.html)"
"What are the two flavors of transaction management in the Spring Framework and how do they differ?","The two flavors of transaction management in the Spring Framework are imperative and reactive. Imperative transactions use PlatformTransactionManager and are thread-bound, while reactive transactions use ReactiveTransactionManager and are context-bound within the same reactive pipeline. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/tx-decl-explained.html)"
"What is the role of the TransactionInterceptor in the Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure?","The TransactionInterceptor detects the desired flavor of transaction management by inspecting the method return type and uses a TransactionManager implementation to drive transactions around method invocations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/tx-decl-explained.html)"
"How does the Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure use AOP proxies and transactional metadata?","The Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure uses AOP proxies and transactional metadata (XML or annotation-based) to create an AOP proxy that uses a TransactionInterceptor in conjunction with a TransactionManager implementation to drive transactions around method invocations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/tx-decl-explained.html)"
"What is the purpose of the <tx:advice/> element in the provided Spring Boot transaction configuration?","The <tx:advice/> element encapsulates the transactional semantics and is used to define the transactional behavior for the service methods. It specifies that all methods starting with 'get' are to run in the context of a read-only transaction, and all other methods are to run with the default transaction semantics. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.html)"
"How is a transactional proxy created around the fooService bean in the provided Spring Boot transaction configuration?","The transactional proxy is created using the AOP infrastructure. The configuration creates an implicit proxy for the fooService bean, which is configured with the transactional advice. When an appropriate method is invoked on the proxy, a transaction is started, suspended, marked as read-only, and so on, depending on the transaction configuration associated with that method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.html)"
"What is the purpose of the <aop:config/> element in the provided Spring Boot transaction configuration?","The <aop:config/> element ensures that the transactional advice defined by the txAdvice bean runs at the appropriate points in the program. It defines a pointcut that matches the execution of any operation defined in the FooService interface and associates the pointcut with the txAdvice using an advisor. This results in the advice defined by txAdvice being run at the execution of a fooServiceOperation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/first-example.html)"
"How can you control the rollback of transactions in a simple, declarative fashion in XML configuration using Spring Boot?","You can control the rollback of transactions in a simple, declarative fashion in XML configuration using Spring Boot by specifying rollback rules. Rollback rules determine if a transaction should be rolled back when a given exception is thrown, and the rules are based on exception types or exception patterns. Rollback rules may be configured in XML via the rollback-for and no-rollback-for attributes, which allow rules to be defined as patterns. You can also indicate a required rollback programmatically using TransactionAspectSupport.currentTransactionStatus().setRollbackOnly(); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.html)"
"What is the recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure that a transaction’s work is to be rolled back?","The recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure that a transaction’s work is to be rolled back is to throw an Exception from code that is currently executing in the context of a transaction. The Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure code catches any unhandled Exception as it bubbles up the call stack and makes a determination whether to mark the transaction for rollback. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.html)"
"What is the default configuration for marking a transaction for rollback in the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure code?","In its default configuration, the Spring Framework’s transaction infrastructure code marks a transaction for rollback only in the case of runtime, unchecked exceptions. That is, when the thrown exception is an instance or subclass of RuntimeException. (Error instances also, by default, result in a rollback). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/rolling-back.html)"
"How can you apply different transactional configurations to different service layer objects in Spring Boot?","You can define distinct <aop:advisor/> elements with differing pointcut and advice-ref attribute values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/diff-tx.html)"
"How do you make all beans that are instances of classes defined in a root package and have names ending in 'Service' have the default transactional configuration?","You can use an <aop:advisor/> element with a pointcut that matches the required classes and methods, and an advice that references the default transactional configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/diff-tx.html)"
"How can you configure two distinct beans with totally different transactional settings in Spring Boot?","You can define two distinct pointcuts that match the required classes and methods, and two distinct advisors that reference the transactional configurations for each bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/diff-tx.html)"
"What is the default propagation setting for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag?","The default propagation setting for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag is REQUIRED. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/txadvice-settings.html>)"
"What is the default isolation level for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag?","The default isolation level for transactions in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag is DEFAULT. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/txadvice-settings.html>)"
"How can you change the default transaction settings in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag?","You can change the default transaction settings in Spring using the <tx:advice/> tag by specifying the required attributes within the <tx:method/> tags that are nested within <tx:advice/> and <tx:attributes/> tags. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/txadvice-settings.html>)"
"What are the two ways to configure transactions in Spring Boot?","The two ways to configure transactions in Spring Boot are XML-based declarative approach and annotation-based approach. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot?","The @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to specify that an interface, class, or method should have transactional semantics. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html)"
"What is the difference between class-based and interface-based proxies in Spring Boot?","Class-based proxies are created when the proxy-target-class attribute is set to true, while interface-based proxies are created when proxy-target-class is false or omitted. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/annotations.html)"
"What is the difference between physical and logical transactions in Spring-managed transactions?","In Spring-managed transactions, physical transactions are actual transactions that affect the underlying resources, while logical transactions are scopes within a method that can determine rollback-only status independently. Each logical transaction scope can be mapped to the same physical transaction or to an independent physical transaction, depending on the propagation setting."
"What does PROPAGATION_REQUIRED mean in Spring transaction propagation?","PROPAGATION_REQUIRED enforces a physical transaction, either locally for the current scope if no transaction exists yet or participating in an existing 'outer' transaction defined for a larger scope. By default, a participating transaction joins the characteristics of the outer scope, silently ignoring the local isolation level, timeout value, or read-only flag (if any)."
"How does PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW differ from PROPAGATION_REQUIRED in Spring transaction propagation?","PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW always uses an independent physical transaction for each affected transaction scope, never participating in an existing transaction for an outer scope. In contrast, PROPAGATION_REQUIRED can participate in an existing transaction for an outer scope and can inherit the characteristics of the outer scope."
"How can you configure a fooService bean with both profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot?","You can configure a fooService bean with both profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot by creating a SimpleProfiler bean that implements the Ordered interface and setting the order property to control the ordering of advice. Then, you can apply the transactional and profiling aspects to the fooService bean using the <tx:annotation-driven/> element and an <aop:config> element, respectively. The following configuration creates a fooService bean with profiling and transactional aspects applied in the desired order: XML configuration code here (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/applying-more-than-just-tx-advice.html>)"
"How do you configure additional aspects with the desired order in Spring Boot?","To configure additional aspects with the desired order in Spring Boot, you can follow a similar approach as shown in the provided information. You can create a new bean for each aspect, set the order property to control the ordering of advice, and then apply the aspect to the desired beans using an <aop:config> element. The order value should be higher than the previous aspect to ensure the desired execution order. For example, to add another aspect, you can create a new bean for the aspect, set the order property, and then apply the aspect using an <aop:advisor> element. The following example creates the same setup as the previous examples but uses the purely XML declarative approach: XML configuration code here (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/applying-more-than-just-tx-advice.html>) "
"How can you change the order of execution for the profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot?","To change the order of execution for the profiling and transactional aspects in Spring Boot, you can modify the order property of the SimpleProfiler bean. If you want the profiling advice to run after the transactional advice on the way in and before the transactional advice on the way out, you can swap the value of the profiling aspect bean’s order property so that it is higher than the transactional advice’s order value. The following configuration demonstrates this change: XML configuration code here (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/applying-more-than-just-tx-advice.html>) "
"How can you use the Spring Framework's @Transactional support outside of a Spring container?","You can use the Spring Framework’s @Transactional support outside of a Spring container by means of an AspectJ aspect. First, annotate your classes (and optionally your classes' methods) with the @Transactional annotation, and then link (weave) your application with the org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect defined in the spring-aspects.jar file. You must also configure the aspect with a transaction manager. The simplest way to configure the transaction management aspect is to use the <tx:annotation-driven/> element and specify the mode attribute to aspectj. For more information, see the Spring Framework reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/aspectj.html"
"What is the importance of configuring the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use a transaction manager before executing any transactional methods?","Configuring the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use a transaction manager before executing any transactional methods is crucial because it enables the AspectJ aspect to manage transactions properly. The transaction manager is responsible for coordinating transactions, and without it, the aspect would not be able to handle transactional operations correctly. For more information, see the Spring Framework reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/aspectj.html"
"What is the difference between annotating a class with @Transactional and annotating a method within that class?","Annotating a class with @Transactional specifies the default transaction semantics for the execution of any public method in the class. On the other hand, annotating a method within the class with @Transactional overrides the default transaction semantics given by the class annotation. You can annotate any method, regardless of visibility. For more information, see the Spring Framework reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/declarative/aspectj.html"
"What are the two means of programmatic transaction management provided by the Spring Framework?","The two means of programmatic transaction management provided by the Spring Framework are using the TransactionTemplate or TransactionalOperator directly or using a TransactionManager implementation directly.

"What is the recommended approach for programmatic transaction management in reactive code?","The recommended approach for programmatic transaction management in reactive code is to use the TransactionalOperator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/programmatic.html)"
"In what scenarios is programmatic transaction management a good choice according to the provided information?","Programmatic transaction management is usually a good idea only if you have a small number of transactional operations, such as a web application that requires transactions only for certain update operations. In this case, using the TransactionTemplate may be a good approach. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-decl-vs-prog.html)"
"What are the benefits of using declarative transaction management over programmatic transaction management in the context of numerous transactional operations?","Declarative transaction management is usually worthwhile if your application has numerous transactional operations. It keeps transaction management out of business logic and is not difficult to configure. When using the Spring Framework, rather than EJB CMT, the configuration cost of declarative transaction management is greatly reduced. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-decl-vs-prog.html)"
"What is the advantage of using the programmatic approach to transaction management in terms of setting the transaction name?","Being able to set the transaction name explicitly is something that can be done only by using the programmatic approach to transaction management. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/tx-decl-vs-prog.html)"
"What is the purpose of binding a Spring event listener to a transaction phase?","The purpose of binding a Spring event listener to a transaction phase is to allow the listener to handle the event only when the transaction has completed successfully. This can be done using the @TransactionalEventListener annotation, which binds the listener to the commit phase of the transaction by default. The phase attribute of the annotation can be used to customize the transaction phase to which the listener should be bound. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/event.html)"
"How can you set up an event listener that handles an event only after the transaction in which it was published has committed successfully?","To set up an event listener that handles an event only after the transaction in which it was published has committed successfully, you can use the @TransactionalEventListener annotation on the listener method. This annotation binds the listener to the commit phase of the transaction by default. For example, in Java, you can use the following code: @Component public class MyComponent { @TransactionalEventListener public void handleOrderCreatedEvent(CreationEvent<Order> creationEvent) { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/event.html)"
"What are the valid transaction phases that can be used with the @TransactionalEventListener annotation?","The valid transaction phases that can be used with the @TransactionalEventListener annotation are BEFORE_COMMIT, AFTER_COMMIT (default), AFTER_ROLLBACK, and AFTER_COMPLETION, which aggregates the transaction completion (be it a commit or a rollback). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/event.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's JtaTransactionManager and how does it enhance transaction semantics?","Spring's JtaTransactionManager is the standard choice to run on Jakarta EE application servers and is known to work on all common servers. It autodetects the location for the JTA TransactionManager object, which varies by application server. Having access to the JTA TransactionManager allows for enhanced transaction semantics, including supporting transaction suspension. This advanced functionality works on many servers without any special configuration required. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.13/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/JtaTransactionManager.html)"
"What is the significance of application server-specific integration in Spring's transaction abstraction?","Spring's transaction abstraction is generally application server-agnostic, meaning it can work with various application servers. However, some features, like transaction suspension, require access to the JTA TransactionManager, which varies by application server. The JtaTransactionManager class in Spring can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA UserTransaction and TransactionManager objects, autodetecting their location. This integration allows for advanced transaction management capabilities. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction/application-server-integration.html)"
"What is the role of JNDI lookup in Spring's JtaTransactionManager and how does it help with transaction management?","The JtaTransactionManager class in Spring can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA UserTransaction and TransactionManager objects. JNDI lookup is a process that allows applications to locate and access resources, such as databases, message queues, and transaction managers, by name. By performing a JNDI lookup, Spring's JtaTransactionManager can autodetect the location of the JTA TransactionManager object, which varies by application server. This integration helps with transaction management by providing enhanced transaction semantics, including transaction suspension, and advanced functionality that works on many servers without any special configuration required.

"What is the purpose of DAO support in Spring?","The purpose of DAO support in Spring is to make it easy to work with data access technologies in a consistent way, allowing you to switch between them easily and code without worrying about catching exceptions specific to each technology. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/dao.html)"
"How does Spring handle technology-specific exceptions in its exception class hierarchy?","Spring provides a convenient translation from technology-specific exceptions to its own exception class hierarchy, which has DataAccessException as the root exception. These exceptions wrap the original exception, ensuring that you never lose any information about what might have gone wrong. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/dao.html)"
"What is the best way to configure DAO or repository classes in Spring?","The best way to configure DAO or repository classes in Spring is to use the @Repository annotation.

"What actions related to JDBC does Spring Framework handle?","Spring Framework handles opening the connection, preparing and running the statement, and closing the connection, the statement, and the resultset. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc.html})"
"What are the different approaches for JDBC database access in Spring?","The different approaches for JDBC database access in Spring include JdbcTemplate, NamedParameterJdbcTemplate, SimpleJdbcInsert, SimpleJdbcCall, and RDBMS objects like MappingSqlQuery, SqlUpdate, and StoredProcedure. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/choose-style.html)"
"What is the difference between JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate?","JdbcTemplate is a low-level approach that uses traditional JDBC ? placeholders, while NamedParameterJdbcTemplate wraps JdbcTemplate and provides named parameters for better documentation and ease of use when dealing with multiple parameters in an SQL statement. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/choose-style.html)"
"How does the SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall approach simplify coding?","The SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall approach simplifies coding by optimizing database metadata, allowing you to only provide the name of the table or procedure and a map of parameters matching the column names. This approach works best when the database provides adequate metadata. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/choose-style.html)"
"What is the main class in the org.springframework.jdbc.core package and what does it do?","The main class in the org.springframework.jdbc.core package is the JdbcTemplate class. It provides a high-level wrapper around JDBC that simplifies basic JDBC processing and error handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/packages.html)"
"What is the purpose of the org.springframework.jdbc.datasource package?","The org.springframework.jdbc.datasource package contains a utility class for easy DataSource access and various simple DataSource implementations that you can use for testing and running unmodified JDBC code outside of a Jakarta EE container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/packages.html)"
"What does the org.springframework.jdbc.support package provide?","The org.springframework.jdbc.support package provides SQLException translation functionality and some utility classes. Exceptions thrown during JDBC processing are translated to exceptions defined in the org.springframework.dao package, which allows for unchecked exceptions and simplifies error handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/packages.html)"
"How can I use JdbcTemplate to control basic JDBC processing and error handling in Spring Boot?","You can use JdbcTemplate to control basic JDBC processing and error handling in Spring Boot by using its methods to run SQL queries, update statements, and stored procedures, as well as handle exception translation. JdbcTemplate handles the creation and release of resources, which helps you avoid common errors such as forgetting to close the connection. It performs the basic tasks of the core JDBC workflow (such as statement creation and execution), leaving application code to provide SQL and extract results. It also catches JDBC exceptions and translates them to the generic, more informative, exception hierarchy defined in the org.springframework.dao package. See the official documentation for more information: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/core.html"
"What is the difference between using JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate in Spring Boot?","The main difference between using JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate in Spring Boot is that JdbcTemplate uses placeholder (?) arguments, while NamedParameterJdbcTemplate uses named parameters. NamedParameterJdbcTemplate provides support for programming JDBC statements by using named parameters, which can make your code more readable and easier to maintain. It wraps a JdbcTemplate and delegates to the wrapped JdbcTemplate to do much of its work. See the official documentation for more information: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/core.html#jdbc-NamedParameterJdbcTemplate"
"How can I use JdbcClient for unified JDBC query/update operations in Spring Boot?","You can use JdbcClient for unified JDBC query/update operations in Spring Boot by creating a JdbcClient instance with the JdbcClient.create(dataSource) method, where dataSource is your DataSource. Then, you can use the fluent API provided by JdbcClient to define your SQL statements, set parameters, and execute queries or updates. JdbcClient provides convenient methods for querying and updating data, as well as support for row mapping and result resolution. See the official documentation for more information: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/core.html#jdbc-JdbcClient"
"What is a DataSource and what is its purpose in Spring?","A DataSource is part of the JDBC specification and is a generalized connection factory. It lets a container or a framework hide connection pooling and transaction management issues from the application code. In Spring, a DataSource is used to obtain a connection to the database. The purpose of a DataSource is to provide a way for developers to obtain a connection to the database without needing to know the details of how the connection is pooled or managed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/connections.html)"
"What are some advantages of using a DataSource in Spring?","Using a DataSource in Spring provides several advantages, including hiding connection pooling and transaction management issues, allowing for easy testing of code outside an application server, and reusing the same connection all the time to avoid excessive creation of physical connections. Additionally, DataSource supports savepoints, custom isolation levels, and timeouts that get applied as appropriate JDBC statement query timeouts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/connections.html)"
"What is the purpose of the DriverManagerDataSource class in Spring?","The DriverManagerDataSource class is an implementation of the standard DataSource interface that configures a plain JDBC driver through bean properties and returns a new Connection every time. This implementation is useful for test and stand-alone environments outside of a Jakarta EE container, either as a DataSource bean in a Spring IoC container or in conjunction with a simple JNDI environment. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/connections.html)"
"What is the purpose of batch operations in JDBC?","Batch operations in JDBC provide improved performance by grouping multiple updates into batches, which limits the number of round trips to the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/advanced.html)"
"How can you accomplish JdbcTemplate batch processing?","JdbcTemplate batch processing is accomplished by implementing two methods of a special interface, BatchPreparedStatementSetter, and passing that implementation in as the second parameter in your batchUpdate method call. You can use the getBatchSize method to provide the size of the current batch and the setValues method to set the values for the parameters of the prepared statement. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/advanced.html)"
"What is the purpose of the InterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter interface?","The InterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter interface allows you to interrupt a batch once the input source is exhausted. The isBatchExhausted method lets you signal the end of the batch. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/advanced.html)"
"What are the benefits of using the SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall classes for JDBC operations in Spring?","The SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall classes provide a simplified configuration by taking advantage of database metadata that can be retrieved through the JDBC driver. This means that you have less to configure up front, although you can override or turn off the metadata processing if you prefer to provide all the details in your code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/simple.html)"
"How do you use the SimpleJdbcInsert class to insert data into a table?","To insert data using the SimpleJdbcInsert class, you should instantiate the SimpleJdbcInsert in the data access layer’s initialization method. You do not need to subclass the SimpleJdbcInsert class. Instead, you can create a new instance and set the table name by using the withTableName method. The execute method used here takes a plain java.util.Map as its only parameter. The important thing to note here is that the keys used for the Map must match the column names of the table, as defined in the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/simple.html)"
"How can you retrieve auto-generated keys when using the SimpleJdbcInsert class?","To retrieve auto-generated keys using the SimpleJdbcInsert class, you specify the name of the generated key column with the usingGeneratedKeyColumns method when creating the SimpleJdbcInsert. The executeAndReturnKey method is then used to execute the insert and return the auto-generated key. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/simple.html)"
"What is the purpose of the org.springframework.jdbc.object package in Spring Boot?","The org.springframework.jdbc.object package contains classes that let you access the database in a more object-oriented manner. It provides a way to run queries, get results as a list of business objects, and run stored procedures and update, delete, and insert statements. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/object.html)"
"What is the role of the SqlQuery class in Spring Boot?","The SqlQuery class is a reusable, thread-safe class that encapsulates an SQL query. Subclasses must implement the newRowMapper(..) method to provide a RowMapper instance that can create one object per row obtained from iterating over the ResultSet that is created during the execution of the query. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/object.html)"
"How can you map rows to Java classes using the MappingSqlQuery class in Spring Boot?","The MappingSqlQuery class is a subclass of SqlQuery that provides a more convenient implementation for mapping rows to Java classes. Subclasses must implement the abstract mapRow(..) method to convert each row of the supplied ResultSet into an object of the type specified. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/object.html)"
"How can you provide SQL type information for parameters when using Spring Framework's JDBC support?","You can provide SQL type information in several ways: Many update and query methods of the JdbcTemplate take an additional parameter in the form of an int array. This array is used to indicate the SQL type of the corresponding parameter by using constant values from the java.sql.Types class. Provide one entry for each parameter. You can use the SqlParameterValue class to wrap the parameter value that needs this additional information. To do so, create a new instance for each value and pass in the SQL type and the parameter value in the constructor. You can also provide an optional scale parameter for numeric values. For methods that work with named parameters, you can use the SqlParameterSource classes, BeanPropertySqlParameterSource or MapSqlParameterSource. They both have methods for registering the SQL type for any of the named parameter values. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/parameter-handling.html>)"
"How can you handle BLOB and CLOB objects when using Spring Framework's JDBC support?","You can handle these large objects by using the JdbcTemplate directly and also when using the higher abstractions provided by RDBMS Objects and the SimpleJdbc classes. All of these approaches use an implementation of the LobHandler interface for the actual management of the LOB (Large OBject) data. LobHandler provides access to a LobCreator class, through the getLobCreator method, that is used for creating new LOB objects to be inserted. LobCreator and LobHandler provide support for BLOB and CLOB input and output, including methods like getBlobAsBytes, setBlobAsBytes, getBlobAsBinaryStream, setBlobAsBinaryStream, getClobAsString, setClobAsString, getClobAsAsciiStream, setClobAsAsciiStream, getClobAsCharacterStream, and setClobAsCharacterStream. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/parameter-handling.html>)"
"How can you pass in a list of values for an IN clause when using Spring Framework's JDBC support?","You can pass in the values as a java.util.List (or any Iterable) of simple values. This list is used to insert the required placeholders into the actual SQL statement and pass in the values during statement execution. Be careful when passing in many values. The JDBC standard does not guarantee that you can use more than 100 values for an IN expression list. Various databases exceed this number, but they usually have a hard limit for how many values are allowed. For example, Oracle's limit is 1000. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/parameter-handling.html>)"
"What are the benefits of using an embedded database during the development phase of a project?","Benefits include ease of configuration, quick startup time, testability, and the ability to rapidly evolve your SQL during development.

"How can you control the creation and deletion of existing data when initializing a database using Spring XML?","You can use the enabled and ignore-failures attributes in the <jdbc:initialize-database> tag to control the creation and deletion of existing data. The enabled attribute allows you to switch the initialization on and off, and the ignore-failures attribute allows you to control the ability of the initializer to ignore certain errors in the SQL it runs from the scripts. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/jdbc/initializing-datasource.html)"
"What is R2DBC and what does it stand for?","R2DBC is a community-driven specification effort to standardize access to SQL databases using reactive patterns. It stands for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/r2dbc.html)"
"What are the two different packages in Spring Framework’s R2DBC abstraction framework?","The Spring Framework’s R2DBC abstraction framework consists of two different packages: core and connection. The org.springframework.r2dbc.core package contains the DatabaseClient class plus a variety of related classes. The org.springframework.r2dbc.connection package contains a utility class for easy ConnectionFactory access and various simple ConnectionFactory implementations that you can use for testing and running unmodified R2DBC. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/r2dbc.html)"
"What is the central class in the R2DBC core package and what does it do?","The central class in the R2DBC core package is the DatabaseClient class. It handles the creation and release of resources, which helps to avoid common errors, such as forgetting to close the connection. It performs the basic tasks of the core R2DBC workflow (such as statement creation and execution), leaving application code to provide SQL and extract results.

"What is the recommended integration style for coding DAOs with Hibernate in Spring?","The recommended integration style is to code DAOs against plain Hibernate or JPA APIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/introduction.html)"
"How does Spring simplify testing of persistence-related code?","Spring's IoC approach makes it easy to swap the implementations and configuration locations of Hibernate SessionFactory instances, JDBC DataSource instances, transaction managers, and mapped object implementations (if needed), which in turn makes it much easier to test each piece of persistence-related code in isolation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring's conversion of ORM exceptions to a common runtime DataAccessException hierarchy?","Spring can wrap exceptions from your ORM tool, converting them from proprietary (potentially checked) exceptions to a common runtime DataAccessException hierarchy. This feature lets you handle most persistence exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the appropriate layers, without annoying boilerplate catches, throws, and exception declarations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/introduction.html)"
"What is the primary aim of Spring's ORM integration?","The major goal of Spring’s ORM integration is clear application layering (with any data access and transaction technology) and for loose coupling of application objects — no more business service dependencies on the data access or transaction strategy, no more hard-coded resource lookups, no more hard-to-replace singletons, no more custom service registries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/orm/general.html)"
"How does Spring handle resource and transaction management in business applications?","Spring advocates simple solutions for proper resource handling, namely IoC through templating in the case of JDBC and applying AOP interceptors for the ORM technologies.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/context-hierarchy.html)"
"What is the purpose of having a context hierarchy in Spring Boot?","Having a context hierarchy allows one root WebApplicationContext to be shared across multiple DispatcherServlet (or other Servlet) instances, each with its own child WebApplicationContext configuration. The root WebApplicationContext typically contains infrastructure beans, such as data repositories and business services that need to be shared across multiple Servlet instances. Those beans are effectively inherited and can be overridden (that is, re-declared) in the Servlet-specific child WebApplicationContext, which typically contains beans local to the given Servlet.

"What is the role of the WebApplicationContext in the DispatcherServlet request processing?","The WebApplicationContext is searched for and bound in the request as an attribute that the controller and other elements in the process can use. It is bound by default under the DispatcherServlet.WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE key. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/sequence.html)"
"What is the purpose of the locale resolver in the DispatcherServlet request processing?","The locale resolver is bound to the request to let elements in the process resolve the locale to use when processing the request (rendering the view, preparing data, and so on). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/sequence.html)"
"How can a handler be searched for in the DispatcherServlet request processing?","An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain associated with the handler (preprocessors, postprocessors, and controllers) is run to prepare a model for rendering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/sequence.html)"
"What is the issue with relying on the servletPath in Spring MVC?","The servletPath comes with the prefix-based servletPath mapping type, which can introduce issues such as the servletPath being normalized to varying degrees by Servlet containers, making it impossible to perform startsWith comparisons against the requestURI. This is why it is best to avoid reliance on the servletPath. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-path.html)"
"How can the issue of decoding the requestURI be resolved in Spring MVC?","The issue of decoding the requestURI can be resolved by using PathPatternParser and parsed patterns, which matches to a parsed representation of the path called RequestPath, one path segment at a time. This allows decoding and sanitizing path segment values individually without the risk of altering the structure of the path. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-path.html)"
"What is the advantage of using PathPatternParser in Spring MVC?","PathPatternParser has the advantage of matching to a parsed representation of the path called RequestPath, one path segment at a time. This allows decoding and sanitizing path segment values individually without the risk of altering the structure of the path. It also supports the use of servletPath prefix mapping as long as a Servlet path mapping is used and the prefix is kept simple, i.e. it has no encoded characters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-path.html)"
"What is the purpose of handler interception in Spring Boot?","Handler interception is useful when you want to apply functionality across requests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-interceptor.html)"
"What is the role of the preHandle method in a HandlerInterceptor?","The preHandle method is a callback before the actual handler is run that returns a boolean. If the method returns true, execution continues; if it returns false, the rest of the execution chain is bypassed and the handler is not called. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-interceptor.html)"
"How can you modify the response after the handler has run?","You can implement ResponseBodyAdvice and declare it as a Controller Advice bean or configure it directly on RequestMappingHandlerAdapter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/handlermapping-interceptor.html)"
"What is the purpose of HandlerExceptionResolver beans in the DispatcherServlet?","HandlerExceptionResolver beans in the DispatcherServlet are responsible for resolving exceptions that occur during request mapping or are thrown from a request handler, typically providing an alternative handling, such as an error response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.html)"
"What is the difference between SimpleMappingExceptionResolver and DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver?","SimpleMappingExceptionResolver is a mapping between exception class names and error view names, useful for rendering error pages in a browser application. DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver resolves exceptions raised by Spring MVC and maps them to HTTP status codes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.html)"
"How can you customize the list of HandlerExceptionResolver beans in your Spring configuration?","You can customize the list of HandlerExceptionResolver beans in your Spring configuration by declaring multiple HandlerExceptionResolver beans and setting their order properties as needed. The higher the order property, the later the exception resolver is positioned in the chain. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ViewResolver interface in Spring MVC?","The ViewResolver interface in Spring MVC provides a mapping between view names and actual views. It addresses the preparation of data before handing over to a specific view technology. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.html)"
"What is the difference between UrlBasedViewResolver and InternalResourceViewResolver?","UrlBasedViewResolver is a simple implementation of the ViewResolver interface that effects the direct resolution of logical view names to URLs without an explicit mapping definition. InternalResourceViewResolver is a convenient subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports InternalResourceView and subclasses such as JstlView, and can be used to specify the view class for all views generated by this resolver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.html)"
"How can you configure view resolution in Spring MVC?","Configuring view resolution in Spring MVC is as simple as adding ViewResolver beans to your Spring configuration. The MVC Config provides a dedicated configuration API for View Resolvers and for adding logic-less View Controllers which are useful for HTML template rendering without controller logic. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/viewresolver.html)"
"How does Spring's architecture support internationalization in the Spring web MVC framework?","Spring's architecture supports internationalization by allowing most parts of the framework to handle internationalization, including the Spring web MVC framework. DispatcherServlet automatically resolves messages using the client's locale with LocaleResolver objects. The locale can be retrieved using the RequestContext.getLocale() method. In addition to automatic locale resolution, interceptors can be used to change the locale under specific circumstances. Locale resolvers and interceptors are defined in the org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n package and are configured in the application context. The following selection of locale resolvers is included in Spring: Time Zone, Header Resolver, Cookie Resolver, Session Resolver, and Locale Interceptor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/localeresolver.html)"
"How can you obtain the client's time zone in addition to the locale in the Spring web MVC framework?","To obtain the client's time zone in addition to the locale, you can use the LocaleContextResolver interface, which extends LocaleResolver and provides a richer LocaleContext that may include time zone information. The user's TimeZone can be obtained using the RequestContext.getTimeZone() method. Time zone information is automatically used by any Date/Time Converter and Formatter objects registered with Spring's ConversionService. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/localeresolver.html)"
"How does the CookieLocaleResolver work in the Spring web MVC framework, and what properties can be configured for it?","The CookieLocaleResolver inspects a Cookie on the client to see if a Locale or TimeZone is specified. It uses the specified details if available. Properties that can be configured for the CookieLocaleResolver include the cookie name and maximum age, as well as the cookie path. The following example defines a CookieLocaleResolver with a cookie name of 'clientlanguage' and a cookie maximum age of 100,000 seconds: <bean id='localeResolver' class='org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.CookieLocaleResolver'> <property name='cookieName' value='clientlanguage'/> <property name='cookieMaxAge' value='100000'/> </bean> The following table describes the properties of CookieLocaleResolver: Table 1. CookieLocaleResolver properties Property Default Description cookieName class name + LOCALE The name of the cookie cookieMaxAge Servlet container default The maximum time a cookie persists on the client. If set to -1, the cookie will not be persisted. It is available only until the client shuts down the browser. cookiePath / Limits the visibility of the cookie to a certain part of your site. When cookiePath is specified, the cookie is visible only to that path and the paths below it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/localeresolver.html)"
"What is the purpose of a theme in the Spring Web MVC framework?","A theme in the Spring Web MVC framework is used to set the overall look-and-feel of your application, thereby enhancing user experience. It is a collection of static resources, typically style sheets and images, that affect the visual style of the application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.html)"
"How do you define a theme in your web application using the Spring Web MVC framework?","To use themes in your web application, you must set up an implementation of the org.springframework.ui.context.ThemeSource interface. The WebApplicationContext interface extends ThemeSource but delegates its responsibilities to a dedicated implementation. By default, the delegate is an org.springframework.ui.context.support.ResourceBundleThemeSource implementation that loads properties files from the root of the classpath. To use a custom ThemeSource implementation or to configure the base name prefix of the ResourceBundleThemeSource , you can register a bean in the application context with the reserved name, themeSource . The web application context automatically detects a bean with that name and uses it. When you use the ResourceBundleThemeSource , a theme is defined in a simple properties file. The properties file lists the resources that make up the theme, as the following example shows: styleSheet=/themes/cool/style.css background=/themes/cool/img/coolBg.jpg The keys of the properties are the names that refer to the themed elements from view code. For a JSP, you typically do this using the spring:theme custom tag, which is very similar to the spring:message tag. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.html)"
"How do you resolve themes in the Spring Web MVC framework?","After you define themes, as described in the preceding section, you decide which theme to use. The DispatcherServlet looks for a bean named themeResolver to find out which ThemeResolver implementation to use. A theme resolver works in much the same way as a LocaleResolver . It detects the theme to use for a particular request and can also alter the request’s theme. The following table describes the theme resolvers provided by Spring: Table 1. ThemeResolver implementations Class Description FixedThemeResolver Selects a fixed theme, set by using the defaultThemeName property. SessionThemeResolver The theme is maintained in the user’s HTTP session. It needs to be set only once for each session but is not persisted between sessions. CookieThemeResolver The selected theme is stored in a cookie on the client. Spring also provides a ThemeChangeInterceptor that lets theme changes on every request with a simple request parameter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/themeresolver.html)"
"What is MultipartResolver in Spring Framework and what does it do?","MultipartResolver in Spring Framework is a strategy for parsing multipart requests including file uploads. It is used to handle multipart requests and expose files in addition to request parameters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/multipart.html)"
"What is the difference between StandardServletMultipartResolver and CommonsMultipartResolver in Spring Framework?","StandardServletMultipartResolver is a container-based implementation for Servlet multipart request parsing, while CommonsMultipartResolver was based on Apache Commons FileUpload. CommonsMultipartResolver is not available anymore as of Spring Framework 6.0, but StandardServletMultipartResolver is still available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/multipart.html)"
"How can you enable Servlet multipart parsing in Spring Framework?","To enable Servlet multipart parsing in Spring Framework, you can set a MultipartConfigElement on the Servlet registration in Java or add a '<multipart-config>' section to the servlet declaration in web.xml. This can be done by creating a bean of type StandardServletMultipartResolver with a name of multipartResolver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/multipart.html)"
"What are the goals of DEBUG-level logging in Spring MVC?","The goals of DEBUG-level logging in Spring MVC are to provide compact, minimal, and human-friendly information that is useful over and over again. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/logging.html)"
"What is the difference between DEBUG and TRACE logging levels in Spring MVC?","Both DEBUG and TRACE logging levels in Spring MVC follow similar principles, but TRACE-level logging can be used for debugging any issue and may show a different level of detail compared to DEBUG. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/logging.html)"
"How can sensitive information be protected when enabling DEBUG and TRACE logging in Spring MVC?","To protect sensitive information when enabling DEBUG and TRACE logging in Spring MVC, request parameters and headers are masked by default. Their logging in full must be enabled explicitly through the enableLoggingRequestDetails property on DispatcherServlet using Java configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/logging.html)"
"What is FormContentFilter and when is it used?","FormContentFilter is a filter provided by the spring-web module that intercepts HTTP PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests with a content type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded. It reads the form data from the body of the request and wraps the ServletRequest to make the form data available through the ServletRequest.getParameter*() family of methods. This is useful because browsers can only submit form data through HTTP GET or HTTP POST, but non-browser clients can use other methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-http-put)"
"What are non-standard headers used for communication in proxies and what are some examples?","Non-standard headers, such as X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Ssl, and X-Forwarded-Prefix, are used to communicate information about the original request to a downstream server. For example, X-Forwarded-Host communicates the original host, X-Forwarded-Port communicates the original port, and X-Forwarded-Proto communicates the original protocol. These headers can be used to create links that point to the correct host, port, and scheme from a client perspective when going through proxies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-forwarded-headers)"
"What is the ShallowEtagHeaderFilter and how does it work?","The ShallowEtagHeaderFilter is a filter that creates a 'shallow' ETag by caching the content written to the response and computing an MD5 hash from it. When a client sends an If-None-Match request header, the filter compares the computed value against the header and returns a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) if the two are equal. This strategy saves network bandwidth but not CPU, as the full response must be computed for each request. The filter has a writeWeakETag parameter that configures the filter to write weak ETags. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-shallow-etag)"
"What is the annotation-based programming model in Spring MVC?","The annotation-based programming model in Spring MVC is a way to define controllers using annotations such as @Controller and @RestController. This model allows for flexible method signatures and does not require extending base classes or implementing specific interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller.html)"
"What are the advantages of using annotated controllers in Spring MVC?","The advantages of using annotated controllers in Spring MVC include flexible method signatures, no need to extend base classes or implement specific interfaces, and the ability to express request mappings, request input, exception handling, and more using annotations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller.html)"
"What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController annotations in Spring MVC?","@Controller is used for traditional web applications, while @RestController is used for RESTful web services. The main difference is that @RestController automatically adds the @ResponseBody annotation to the controller methods, which means that the method return value is directly serialized and returned in the HTTP response body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller.html)"
"How can you define controller beans in Spring Boot using Java configuration?","You can define controller beans in Spring Boot using Java configuration by adding component scanning to your configuration, as shown in the following example: Java Kotlin @Configuration @ComponentScan(""org.example.web"") public class WebConfig { // ... } @Configuration @ComponentScan(""org.example.web"") class WebConfig { // ... } (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann.html>)"
"What is the difference between @Controller and @RestController annotations in Spring Boot?","@Controller is a stereotype annotation that allows for auto-detection of controller beans, while @RestController is a composed annotation that inherits from @Controller and @ResponseBody, indicating a controller whose every method writes directly to the response body. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann.html>) "
"What is the recommended approach for AOP proxying in Spring Boot controllers?","For controllers specifically, it is recommended to use class-based proxying. If the controller implements an interface and needs AOP proxying, you may need to explicitly configure class-based proxying. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann.html>) "
"What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Spring MVC?","The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map requests to controller methods in Spring MVC. It has various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media types. It can be used at the class level to express shared mappings or at the method level to narrow down to a specific endpoint mapping. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"How can I specify the HTTP methods that a controller method should handle using @RequestMapping?","You can use the HTTP method-specific shortcut variants of @RequestMapping, such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping, to specify the HTTP methods that a controller method should handle. These shortcuts are provided because most controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"How can I narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request?","To narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request, you can use the consumes attribute in the @RequestMapping annotation or its method-specific shortcut variants. The consumes attribute allows you to specify the content types that the controller method can consume. You can also use negation expressions to specify content types that the method cannot consume. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"What is the name of the section that discusses the flexible signature of @RequestMapping handler methods and the range of supported controller method arguments and return values?","Section Summary (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"What is the difference between the HttpMethod argument and the java.util.Locale argument in a Spring MVC controller method?","The HttpMethod argument represents the HTTP method of the request, while the java.util.Locale argument represents the current request locale determined by the most specific LocaleResolver available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestBody and HttpEntity<B> arguments in a Spring MVC controller method?","The @RequestBody argument is used for accessing the HTTP request body, while the HttpEntity<B> argument is used for accessing request headers and body. The body is converted with an HttpMessageConverter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @ResponseBody annotation in Spring MVC?","The @ResponseBody annotation converts the return value of a controller method through HttpMessageConverter implementations and writes it to the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpEntity and ResponseEntity in Spring MVC?","HttpEntity specifies the full response, including HTTP headers and body, while ResponseEntity is a more specific version of HttpEntity that can be used to return a response with headers and body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What is the purpose of the HttpHeaders class in Spring MVC?","The HttpHeaders class is used for returning a response with headers and no body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What are the annotated controller method arguments that represent String-based request input in Spring Boot?","@RequestParam, @RequestHeader, @PathVariable, @MatrixVariable, and @CookieValue (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"How can you customize type conversion in Spring Boot?","Through a WebDataBinder (see DataBinder(../ann-initbinder.html)) or by registering Formatters with the FormattingConversionService.

This can be the case for Long, UUID, and other target types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"What is the purpose of matrix variables in Spring MVC?","Matrix variables in Spring MVC are used to handle name-value pairs in path segments. They can be referred to as URI path parameters and can appear in any path segment, separated by a semicolon. Multiple values can be separated by a comma or repeated variable names can be used to specify multiple values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html)"
"How can you disambiguate which path variable a matrix variable is expected to be in?","To disambiguate which path variable a matrix variable is expected to be in, you can use the @MatrixVariable annotation with the name and pathVar attributes. This allows you to specify the name of the matrix variable and the path variable it is expected to be in. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html)"
"How can you define a matrix variable as optional and specify a default value?","To define a matrix variable as optional and specify a default value, you can use the @MatrixVariable annotation with the required and defaultValue attributes. Setting required to false makes the matrix variable optional, and defaultValue specifies the default value to be used if the matrix variable is not present. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestParam annotation in Spring Boot?","The @RequestParam annotation is used to bind Servlet request parameters (query parameters or form data) to a method argument in a controller. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can you make a method parameter optional using the @RequestParam annotation?","You can make a method parameter optional by setting the @RequestParam annotation's required flag to false or by declaring the argument with a java.util.Optional wrapper.

"How does the @ModelAttribute annotation work in Spring MVC?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC binds request parameters onto a model object. It can bind to an instance of a specified class, which can be accessed from the model, HTTP session, or obtained through a Converter. The model object can be customized with constructor or property data binding, and security considerations should be taken into account. When using constructor binding, request parameter names can be customized with the @BindParam annotation. The @ModelAttribute annotation is optional, but it's recommended to use it for GraalVM native images. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How can I handle validation errors when using @ModelAttribute in Spring MVC?","To handle validation errors when using @ModelAttribute in Spring MVC, you can add a BindingResult argument immediately next to the @ModelAttribute in the controller method. This will allow you to handle the errors in the controller method. Alternatively, you can use the @Validated annotation to automatically apply validation after data binding. If there is no BindingResult parameter after the @ModelAttribute, then MethodArgumentNotValueException is raised with the validation errors. If method validation applies because other parameters have @jakarta.validation.Constraint annotations, then HandlerMethodValidationException is raised instead. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How can I access a model attribute without data binding in Spring MVC?","To access a model attribute without data binding in Spring MVC, you can inject the Model into the controller and access it directly. Alternatively, you can set @ModelAttribute(binding=false) on the model attribute to prevent data binding. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot?","The @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot is used to store model attributes in the HTTP Servlet session between requests. It declares the session attributes used by a specific controller and typically lists the names or types of model attributes that should be stored in the session for subsequent requests to access. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How is a model attribute with the name 'pet' stored in the HTTP Servlet session using the @SessionAttributes annotation?","In a controller class annotated with @SessionAttributes('pet'), when a model attribute with the name 'pet' is added to the model on the first request, it is automatically saved in the HTTP Servlet session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How can the model attribute 'pet' be cleared from the HTTP Servlet session using the @SessionAttributes annotation?","The model attribute 'pet' can be cleared from the HTTP Servlet session by using a SessionStatus method argument in a controller method and calling the setComplete() method on the SessionStatus object. This will remove the 'pet' attribute from the session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"What happens to all model attributes by default when a redirect is performed in Spring MVC?","By default, all model attributes are considered to be exposed as URI template variables in the redirect URL.

"How are flash attributes managed in Spring MVC?","Spring MVC has two main abstractions in support of flash attributes: FlashMap is used to hold flash attributes, while FlashMapManager is used to store, retrieve, and manage FlashMap instances. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.html)"
"How can concurrency issues be reduced when using flash attributes in Spring MVC?","RedirectView automatically ‘stamps’ FlashMap instances with the path and query parameters of the target redirect URL, which reduces the possibility of concurrency issues by matching that information to incoming requests when it looks up the ‘input’ FlashMap. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.html)"
"How can you access multiple uploaded files in a Spring Boot controller?","You can access multiple uploaded files in a Spring Boot controller by declaring the argument type as a List<MultipartFile>, which allows for resolving multiple files for the same parameter name. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html>)"
"How can you access multipart data in a Spring Boot controller as part of data binding to a command object?","You can access multipart data in a Spring Boot controller as part of data binding to a command object by declaring the form field and file from the preceding example as fields on a form object, as shown in the example provided. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html>)"
"How can you handle validation errors for multipart data in a Spring Boot controller?","You can handle validation errors for multipart data in a Spring Boot controller by using @RequestPart in combination with jakarta.validation.Valid or Spring's @Validated annotation, which causes Standard Bean Validation to be applied. By default, validation errors cause a MethodArgumentNotValidException, which is turned into a 400 (BAD_REQUEST) response. Alternatively, you can handle validation errors locally within the controller through an Errors or BindingResult argument, as shown in the example provided. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestBody annotation in Spring Boot?","The @RequestBody annotation is used to have the request body read and deserialized into an Object through an HttpMessageConverter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"How can you configure or customize message conversion in Spring Boot?","You can use the Message Converters option of the MVC Config to configure or customize message conversion. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"Can you use the @RequestBody annotation to read form data in Spring Boot?","No, you should use the @RequestParam annotation to read form data, not @RequestBody, as @RequestBody can't always be used reliably and can cause issues with parsing the request body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpEntity and @RequestBody in Spring Boot?","HttpEntity is more or less identical to using @RequestBody but is based on a container object that exposes request headers and body. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html})"
"How can I handle HTTP requests with HttpEntity in a Spring Boot controller?","To handle HTTP requests with HttpEntity in a Spring Boot controller, you can use the @PostMapping annotation and define a method that takes an HttpEntity object as a parameter. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html})"
"How can I access the request body and headers in a Spring Boot controller using HttpEntity?","To access the request body and headers in a Spring Boot controller using HttpEntity, you can use the getBody() and getHeaders() methods on the HttpEntity object. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html})"
"What is the purpose of the @ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot?","The @ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot is used on a method to have the return serialized to the response body through an HttpMessageConverter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"Can the @ResponseBody annotation be used at the class level in Spring Boot?","Yes, the @ResponseBody annotation can be used at the class level in Spring Boot, in which case it is inherited by all controller methods. This is the effect of @RestController, which is a meta-annotation marked with @Controller and @ResponseBody. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"How can you use the @ResponseBody annotation with reactive types in Spring Boot?","You can use the @ResponseBody annotation with reactive types in Spring Boot. For more details, see Asynchronous Requests and Reactive Types in the Spring Boot documentation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"What is the difference between ResponseEntity and @ResponseBody in Spring Boot?","ResponseEntity is similar to @ResponseBody but provides additional functionality for setting status and headers. It is used to return a response entity with a specific status code and headers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How can I return a ResponseEntity with a specific body and headers in a Spring Boot controller method?","You can return a ResponseEntity with a specific body and headers by using the ResponseEntity.ok() method and providing the body and headers as parameters. For example: return ResponseEntity.ok().eTag(etag).body(body); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"Can I use a reactive type to produce a ResponseEntity asynchronously in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can use a single value reactive type to produce the ResponseEntity asynchronously in Spring Boot. This allows you to set the response status and headers immediately while the body is provided asynchronously at a later point. You can use Mono if the body consists of 0..1 values or Flux if it can produce multiple values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How does Spring MVC provide support for Jackson's Serialization Views?","Spring MVC provides built-in support for Jackson's Serialization Views, which allow rendering only a subset of all fields in an Object. This can be achieved by using Jackson's @JsonView annotation to activate a serialization view class."
"What is the purpose of the @JsonView annotation in Spring MVC?","The @JsonView annotation in Spring MVC is used to activate a serialization view class, allowing the rendering of a subset of all fields in an Object."
"How can you activate multiple serialization views in a controller method?","To activate multiple serialization views in a controller method, you can use a composite interface. However, @JsonView allows an array of view classes, but you can specify only one per controller method."
"What is the purpose of the @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC is used to create or access an Object from the model and to bind it to the request through a WebDataBinder. It can be used on a method argument in @RequestMapping methods, as a method-level annotation in @Controller or @ControllerAdvice classes, or on a @RequestMapping method to mark its return value as a model attribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"How can a @ModelAttribute method be shared across controllers in Spring MVC?","A @ModelAttribute method can be shared across controllers in Spring MVC through @ControllerAdvice. This allows the method to be used in multiple controllers without the need to duplicate the code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"What is the default name chosen for a model attribute when using @ModelAttribute?","When using @ModelAttribute, the default name chosen for a model attribute is based on the Object type, as explained in the javadoc for Conventions. You can always assign an explicit name by using the overloaded addAttribute method or through the name attribute on @ModelAttribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot?","The @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot is used to initialize WebDataBinder instances. It can be used to bind request parameters to a model object, convert request values from string to object property types, and format model object properties as strings when rendering HTML forms. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"How can I register PropertyEditor, Converter, and Formatter components for type conversion in Spring Boot?","You can register PropertyEditor, Converter, and Formatter components in the DataBinder for type conversion by using the @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"What is the difference between constructor binding and property binding in Spring Boot?","Constructor binding uses only the request parameters it needs for constructor arguments, while property binding binds every request parameter for which there is a matching property. Constructor binding is preferred over property binding to prevent unexpected properties from being set. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"What are the two levels of validation in Spring MVC for @RequestMapping methods?","The two levels of validation in Spring MVC for @RequestMapping methods are @ModelAttribute, @RequestBody, and @RequestPart argument resolvers, and method validation.

"How do I handle exceptions in a Spring Boot controller using annotations?","You can use the @ExceptionHandler annotation in a @Controller or @ControllerAdvice class to handle exceptions from controller methods. The annotation can be used with a method that takes the exception as an argument and returns a response entity. The exception type can be specified as a method argument, and the method can be narrowed to match specific exception types. The behavior of root and cause exception matching can be surprising, so it's recommended to be as specific as possible in the argument signature. The distinction between root and cause exception matching can be controlled by the ExceptionDepthComparator and the order of the @ControllerAdvice beans. The passed-in exception is the actual FileSystemException or RemoteException instance only when they are thrown as top-level exceptions. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-exceptionhandler.html>)"
"What are the different types of arguments that can be used in an @ExceptionHandler method?","An @ExceptionHandler method can take the following arguments: Exception, HandlerMethod, WebRequest, NativeWebRequest, jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest, jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse, jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession, java.security.Principal, HttpMethod, java.util.Locale, java.util.TimeZone, java.time.ZoneId, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Writer, java.util.Map, org.springframework.ui.Model, org.springframework.ui.ModelMap, RedirectAttributes, @SessionAttribute, @RequestAttribute. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-exceptionhandler.html>)"

The return value can be used to convert the response through HttpMessageConverter instances, write to the response, render an RFC 9457 error response, add attributes to the model, or indicate no response body for REST controllers or default view name selection for HTML controllers. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-exceptionhandler.html>)"
"What is the purpose of @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice in Spring Boot?","The @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations are used to provide global exception handling and other advice for controller methods. They can be used to handle exceptions from any @Controller or other handler, and can be applied to any controller. The @RestControllerAdvice is meta-annotated with @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody, meaning that @ExceptionHandler methods will have their return value rendered via response body message conversion, rather than via HTML views. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.html)"
"How do you target specific controllers or packages with @ControllerAdvice?","You can target specific controllers or packages with @ControllerAdvice by using the annotations, assignableTypes, and basePackages attributes. For example, you can target all controllers annotated with @RestController, all controllers within specific packages, or all controllers assignable to specific classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.html)"
"How do local and global @ExceptionHandler methods interact in Spring Boot?","Local @ExceptionHandler methods, from the @Controller class, are applied before global @ExceptionHandler methods, from an @ControllerAdvice. Global @ExceptionHandler methods are applied after local ones, meaning that if both exist for the same exception, the global method will be executed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.html)"
"What is WebMvc.fn and what is its purpose?","WebMvc.fn is a lightweight functional programming model in Spring Web MVC that uses functions to route and handle requests. It is an alternative to the annotation-based programming model and runs on the same DispatcherServlet. Its purpose is to provide an immutable contract for handling HTTP requests with HandlerFunction and routing incoming requests to a handler function with RouterFunction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html)"
"What are the main components of WebMvc.fn?","The main components of WebMvc.fn are RouterFunction, HandlerFunction, ServerRequest, and ServerResponse. RouterFunction routes requests to a handler function, HandlerFunction handles the requests, ServerRequest is an immutable interface that provides access to the HTTP request, and ServerResponse is also an immutable interface that provides access to the HTTP response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html)"
"How can you filter handler functions in WebMvc.fn?","You can filter handler functions in WebMvc.fn by using the before, after, or filter methods on the routing function builder. These methods take a HandlerFilterFunction, which is a function that takes a ServerRequest and HandlerFunction and returns a ServerResponse. The handler function parameter represents the next element in the chain, which is typically the handler that is routed to, but it can also be another filter if multiple are applied. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html)"
"How can I build a URI using UriComponentsBuilder in Spring Framework?","You can use UriComponentsBuilder to build a URI by following these steps: 1. Create a UriComponentsBuilder instance using the static factory method fromUriString(). 2. Add or replace URI components using the queryParam() method. 3. Request to have the URI template and URI variables encoded using the encode() method. 4. Build a UriComponents instance using the build() method. 5. Expand variables and obtain the URI using the expand() and toUri() methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html)"
"What is the difference between UriComponentsBuilder#encode() and UriComponents#encode() in Spring Framework?","UriComponentsBuilder#encode() pre-encodes the URI template first and then strictly encodes URI variables when expanded, while UriComponents#encode() encodes URI components after URI variables are expanded. The former replaces characters with reserved meaning that appear in URI variables, while the latter does not replace characters with reserved meaning. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html)"
"How can I create a link to a controller method in Spring MVC?","You can use MvcUriComponentsBuilder to create a link to a controller method by referring to the method by name or using a technique akin to mock testing through proxies to avoid referring to the controller method by name. You can provide actual method argument values to be used as path variables and insert them into the URL. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-uri-building.html)"
"How can a controller method return a single asynchronous return value in Spring MVC?","A controller method can return a DeferredResult or a Callable to provide basic support for a single asynchronous return value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.html)"
"How can a controller method produce multiple asynchronous values and have them written to the response in Spring MVC?","A controller method can return a ResponseBodyEmitter, SseEmitter, or StreamingResponseBody to produce multiple asynchronous values and have them written to the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.html)"
"How does Spring MVC handle reactive types in controller methods?","Spring MVC supports use of reactive client libraries in a controller and adapts reactive types to similar behaviors as DeferredResult, ResponseBodyEmitter, or SseEmitter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-async.html)"
"What is CORS and why is it important for security?","CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that allows a web application running at one origin to make requests to a resource at a different origin. For security reasons, browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources outside the current origin. CORS is important for security because it prevents scripts from malicious websites from making AJAX requests to sensitive resources on a user's behalf, such as a bank account, without the user's knowledge or consent."
"How does Spring MVC handle CORS?","Spring MVC provides built-in support for handling CORS. After successfully mapping a request to a handler, HandlerMapping implementations check the CORS configuration for the given request and handler and take further actions. Preflight requests are handled directly, while simple and actual CORS requests are intercepted, validated, and have required CORS response headers set. Each HandlerMapping can be configured individually with URL pattern-based CorsConfiguration mappings, and applications can use the MVC Java configuration or the XML namespace to declare such mappings, which results in a single global map being passed to all HandlerMapping instances."
"What is the @CrossOrigin annotation in Spring MVC, and how is it used?","The @CrossOrigin annotation enables cross-origin requests on annotated controller methods. By default, it allows all origins, all headers, and all HTTP methods to which the controller method is mapped. The annotation can be used at the class level and is inherited by all methods. It can also be used at both the class level and the method level. The annotation can be customized to allow specific origins, headers, methods, and expose headers. The allowCredentials attribute is not enabled by default and should only be used where appropriate, as it establishes a trust level that exposes sensitive user-specific information."
"What is the Spring Framework's support for including details in the body of error responses for REST services?","The Spring Framework supports the 'Problem Details for HTTP APIs' specification, RFC 9457. The main abstractions for this support are ProblemDetail, ErrorResponse, and ErrorResponseException. ProblemDetail is a representation for an RFC 9457 problem detail, while ErrorResponse is a contract to expose HTTP error response details including HTTP status, response headers, and a body in the format of RFC 9457. ErrorResponseException is a basic ErrorResponse implementation that others can use as a convenient base class. All Spring MVC exceptions implement this. ResponseEntityExceptionHandler is a convenient base class for an @ControllerAdvice that handles all Spring MVC exceptions, and any ErrorResponseException, and renders an error response with a body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can you render an RFC 9457 response in Spring MVC?","You can return ProblemDetail or ErrorResponse from any @ExceptionHandler or from any @RequestMapping method to render an RFC 9457 response. The status property of ProblemDetail determines the HTTP status. The instance property of ProblemDetail is set from the current URL path, if not already set. For content negotiation, the Jackson HttpMessageConverter prefers 'application/problem+json' over 'application/json' when rendering a ProblemDetail, and also falls back on it if no compatible media type is found. To enable RFC 9457 responses for Spring WebFlux exceptions and for any ErrorResponseException, extend ResponseEntityExceptionHandler and declare it as an @ControllerAdvice in Spring configuration. The handler has an @ExceptionHandler method that handles any ErrorResponse exception, which includes all built-in web exceptions. You can add more exception handling methods, and use a protected method to map any exception to a ProblemDetail. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can you extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields in Spring MVC?","You can extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields in one of two ways. One, insert into the 'properties' Map of ProblemDetail. When using the Jackson library, the Spring Framework registers ProblemDetailJacksonMixin that ensures this 'properties' Map is unwrapped and rendered as top level JSON properties in the response, and likewise any unknown property during deserialization is inserted into this Map. You can also extend ProblemDetail to add dedicated non-standard properties. The copy constructor in ProblemDetail allows a subclass to make it easy to be created from an existing ProblemDetail. This could be done centrally, e.g. from an @ControllerAdvice such as ResponseEntityExceptionHandler that re-creates the ProblemDetail of an exception into a subclass with the additional non-standard fields. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"What project provides support for protecting web applications from malicious exploits?","The Spring Security project provides support for protecting web applications from malicious exploits. (Source: https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)"

"What is the WebSocket protocol and how does it work?","The WebSocket protocol is a standardized way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server over a single TCP connection. It begins with an HTTP request that uses the HTTP Upgrade header to switch to the WebSocket protocol. A successful handshake results in the TCP socket remaining open for both client and server to send and receive messages. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket.html)"
"How does the WebSocket protocol differ from HTTP in terms of architecture and application programming models?","WebSocket has an asynchronous, event-driven, messaging architecture, while HTTP follows a request-response style with many URLs. In WebSocket, there is usually only one URL for the initial connect, and all application messages flow on that same TCP connection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket.html)"
"What factors should be considered when deciding whether to use WebSocket for a web application?","Low latency, high frequency, and high volume of messages make the best case for using WebSocket.

A SockJS Java client is available in the spring-websocket module since version 4.1. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/fallback.html)"
"What are the different transport types supported by SockJS?","SockJS supports three general categories of transports: WebSocket, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP Long Polling. The WebSocket transport requires only a single HTTP request to do the WebSocket handshake, while HTTP transports require more requests. Ajax/XHR streaming, for example, relies on one long-running request for server-to-client messages and additional HTTP POST requests for client-to-server messages. Long polling is similar, except that it ends the current request after each server-to-client send. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/fallback.html)"

It was originally created for scripting languages to connect to enterprise message brokers and is designed to address a minimal subset of commonly used messaging patterns. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/overview.html)"
"What is the structure of a STOMP frame?","The structure of a STOMP frame consists of a COMMAND, headers, and a Body, followed by a termination character (^@). Frames are modeled on HTTP and can be used to send or subscribe for messages, along with a destination header that describes what the message is about and who should receive it. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/overview.html)"
"How does Spring's STOMP support work with a dedicated STOMP broker?","When Spring's STOMP support is configured to work with a dedicated STOMP broker, Spring maintains TCP connections to the broker, relays messages to it, and passes messages from it down to connected WebSocket clients. This allows Spring web applications to rely on unified HTTP-based security, common validation, and a familiar programming model for message handling. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/overview.html)"
"What are the benefits of using STOMP as a sub-protocol in Spring Framework?","Using STOMP as a sub-protocol in Spring Framework provides several benefits, including no need to invent a custom messaging protocol and message format, availability of STOMP clients including a Java client in the Spring Framework, optional use of message brokers to manage subscriptions and broadcast messages, organization of application logic in multiple @Controller instances, routing of messages based on the STOMP destination header, and securing messages using Spring Security.

These methods support flexible method signatures and support the same method argument types and return values as @MessageMapping methods."
"How can an application component send messages to the brokerChannel in Spring Boot WebSocket?","The easiest way is to inject a SimpMessagingTemplate and use it to send messages. This can be done by injecting it by type or qualifying it by its name (brokerMessagingTemplate). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-send.html)"
"What is the purpose of the SimpMessagingTemplate in Spring Boot WebSocket?","The SimpMessagingTemplate is used to send messages to the brokerChannel from any part of the application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-send.html)"
"How can a bean of the same type as SimpMessagingTemplate be injected if another bean of the same type exists?","It can be qualified by its name (brokerMessagingTemplate). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-send.html)"
"What is the Simple Message Broker in Spring Boot and what does it handle?","The Simple Message Broker in Spring Boot handles subscription requests from clients, stores them in memory, and broadcasts messages to connected clients that have matching destinations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-simple-broker.html)"
"What kind of destinations does the Simple Message Broker support?","The Simple Message Broker supports path-like destinations, including subscriptions to Ant-style destination patterns. Applications can also use dot-separated (rather than slash-separated) destinations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-simple-broker.html)"
"How can you configure a task scheduler for the Simple Message Broker to support STOMP heartbeats?","To configure a scheduler, you can declare your own TaskScheduler bean and set it through the MessageBrokerRegistry. Alternatively, you can use the one that is automatically declared in the built-in WebSocket configuration, however, you’ll need @Lazy to avoid a cycle between the built-in WebSocket configuration and your WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-simple-broker.html)"
"What is the main limitation of the simple broker in Spring Boot?","The simple broker in Spring Boot supports only a subset of STOMP commands, does not support acks, receipts, and some other features, relies on a simple message-sending loop, and is not suitable for clustering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay.html)"
"How can you upgrade your Spring Boot applications to use a full-featured message broker?","You can upgrade your Spring Boot applications to use a full-featured message broker by installing the broker, running it with STOMP support enabled, and then enabling the STOMP broker relay in the Spring configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay.html)"
"What is the role of the STOMP broker relay in Spring Boot?","The STOMP broker relay is a Spring MessageHandler that handles messages by forwarding them to an external message broker. It establishes TCP connections to the broker, forwards all messages to it, and then forwards all messages received from the broker to clients through their WebSocket sessions. Essentially, it acts as a relay that forwards messages in both directions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'system' TCP connection maintained by the STOMP broker relay?","The 'system' TCP connection is used for messages originating from the server-side application only, not for receiving messages. It is also used to send and receive heartbeats to and from the message broker. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.html)"
"How can you configure the STOMP credentials for the 'system' TCP connection in the XML namespace and Java configuration?","You can configure the STOMP credentials for the 'system' TCP connection using the systemLogin and systemPasscode properties in both the XML namespace and Java configuration. The default values for these properties are 'guest' and 'guest'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.html)"
"How does the STOMP broker relay handle WebSocket client authentication?","The STOMP broker relay relies on HTTP authentication to protect the WebSocket endpoint and establish the client identity. WebSocket clients should not set the login and passcode headers as they are ignored. Instead, they should rely on HTTP authentication. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.html)"
"In Spring Boot, how can you switch the separator for message mapping patterns from slash to dot?","You can switch the separator for message mapping patterns from slash to dot by using the AntPathMatcher in Java configuration or XML configuration. In Java configuration, you can set the pathMatcher to use a dot as the separator by adding 'registry.setPathMatcher(new AntPathMatcher("".""));' in the configureMessageBroker method. In XML configuration, you can define a bean for the AntPathMatcher with a constructor argument of '.' and set it as the pathMatcher for the message broker. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/destination-separator.html)"
"How can you use a dot as the separator in @MessageMapping methods after switching the separator in Spring Boot?","After switching the separator in Spring Boot, you can use a dot as the separator in @MessageMapping methods by adding the dot as the separator in the method's annotation. For example, @MessageMapping('red.blue.{green}') will use the dot as the separator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/destination-separator.html)"
"How does changing the separator in Spring Boot affect the broker and the way it matches destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions?","Changing the separator in Spring Boot affects the broker and the way it matches destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions. If you switch the separator, that change also applies to the broker and the way the broker matches destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/destination-separator.html)"
"How does Spring handle user authentication for WebSocket and SockJS sessions?","Spring automatically associates the authenticated user from the HTTP request with a WebSocket or SockJS session created for them and, subsequently, with all STOMP messages transported over that session through a user header. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/authentication.html)"
"What is the purpose of the STOMP protocol's login and passcode headers on the CONNECT frame?","The login and passcode headers on the CONNECT frame were originally designed for and are needed for STOMP over TCP. However, for STOMP over WebSocket, by default, Spring ignores authentication headers at the STOMP protocol level, and assumes that the user is already authenticated at the HTTP transport level. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/authentication.html)"
"How is the security context for an authenticated user maintained in a typical web application?","The security context for the authenticated user is saved in the HTTP session and is associated with subsequent requests in the same cookie-based session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/authentication.html)"
"What is Token Authentication in Spring Security OAuth and how can it be used for Web applications and STOMP over WebSocket interactions?","Token Authentication in Spring Security OAuth is a support for token-based security, including JSON Web Token (JWT). It can be used as the authentication mechanism in Web applications, including STOMP over WebSocket interactions to maintain identity through a cookie-based session. However, cookie-based sessions are not always the best fit, especially in applications that do not maintain a server-side session or in mobile applications where it is common to use headers for authentication."
"What limitations are there for browser-based clients when it comes to authentication at the HTTP protocol level?","Browser-based clients can only use standard authentication headers (such as basic HTTP authentication) or cookies and cannot provide custom headers. They also do not have a way to send HTTP headers with SockJS transport requests, but they can send query parameters that can be used to send a token. However, this has its own drawbacks, such as the token possibly being logged with the URL in server logs."
"How can applications avoid using cookies for authentication and instead authenticate with headers at the STOMP messaging protocol level?","Applications can avoid using cookies for authentication by authenticating with headers at the STOMP messaging protocol level. This requires using the STOMP client to pass authentication headers at connect time and processing the authentication headers with a ChannelInterceptor. The server-side configuration can register a custom authentication interceptor, and the custom interceptor needs only to authenticate and set the user header on the CONNECT Message. Spring notes and saves the authenticated user and associates it with subsequent STOMP messages on the same session."
"How does Spring Security provide authorization for WebSocket sub-protocol messages?","Spring Security uses a ChannelInterceptor to authorize messages based on the user header in them. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-authorization)"
"What does Spring Session provide in terms of WebSocket integration?","Spring Session ensures the user's HTTP session does not expire while the WebSocket session is still active. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/reference/web-socket.html)"
"Where can I find more information about WebSocket sub-protocol authorization in Spring Security?","You can find more information in the Spring Security Reference Guide under the 'WebSocket Integration' section, specifically 'WebSocket Authorization'. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-authorization)"
"How does Spring's STOMP support handle messages targeting a specific user?","Spring's STOMP support recognizes destinations prefixed with /user/ for messages targeting a specific user. For example, a client might subscribe to the /user/queue/position-updates destination. UserDestinationMessageHandler handles this destination and transforms it into a destination unique to the user session (such as /queue/position-updates-user123 ). This provides the convenience of subscribing to a generically named destination while, at the same time, ensuring no collisions with other users who subscribe to the same destination so that each user can receive unique stock position updates. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/user-destination.html)"
"What is the importance of configuring broker and application destination prefixes when working with user destinations?","Configuring broker and application destination prefixes is crucial when working with user destinations. If not configured, the broker would handle ""/user"" prefixed messages that should only be handled by UserDestinationMessageHandler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/user-destination.html)"
"How can a message-handling method send messages to the user associated with the message being handled?","A message-handling method can send messages to the user associated with the message being handled through the @SendToUser annotation (also supported on the class-level to share a common destination). For example, @Controller public class PortfolioController { @MessageMapping(""/trade"") @SendToUser(""/queue/position-updates"") public TradeResult executeTrade(Trade trade, Principal principal) { // ... return tradeResult; } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/user-destination.html)"
"How can I ensure that messages from the broker are published to the clientOutboundChannel in the exact order they were published?","You can set the setPreservePublishOrder flag to true in the MessageBrokerRegistry configuration. This can be done as follows: @Configuration @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker public class MyConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer { @Override protected void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry registry) { // ... registry.setPreservePublishOrder(true); } } The XML configuration equivalent is: <beans xmlns=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:websocket=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket"" xsi:schemaLocation="" http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket https://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket/spring-websocket.xsd""> <websocket:message-broker preserve-publish-order=""true""> <!-- ... --> </websocket:message-broker> </beans> (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html>)"
"What is the performance impact of enabling ordered publishing for messages within the same client session?","Enabling ordered publishing for messages within the same client session incurs a small performance overhead. This is because messages are processed one at a time on the clientOutboundChannel to maintain the order of publication. Therefore, you should enable ordered publishing only if it is required. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html>)"
"How can I ensure that messages from the client are handled in the exact order they were received?","To ensure that messages from the client are handled in the exact order they were received, you can set the setPreserveReceiveOrder flag to true in the StompEndpointRegistry configuration. This can be done as follows: @Configuration @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker public class MyConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer { @Override public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) { registry.setPreserveReceiveOrder(true); } } (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/ordered-messages.html>)"
"What events are published in Spring's ApplicationContext for STOMP WebSocket communication?","Several ApplicationContext events are published and can be received by implementing Spring’s ApplicationListener interface: BrokerAvailabilityEvent, SessionConnectEvent, SessionConnectedEvent, SessionSubscribeEvent, SessionUnsubscribeEvent, and SessionDisconnectEvent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.html)"
"What does the BrokerAvailabilityEvent indicate and when is it published?","The BrokerAvailabilityEvent indicates when the broker becomes available or unavailable. It is published whenever the state changes from connected to disconnected and vice-versa. Components that use the SimpMessagingTemplate should subscribe to this event and avoid sending messages at times when the broker is not available. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.html)"
"What information is contained in a SessionConnectEvent and how can it be used?","A SessionConnectEvent contains the message that represents the connect, including the session ID, user information (if any), and any custom headers the client sent. It is useful for tracking client sessions. Components subscribed to this event can wrap the contained message with SimpMessageHeaderAccessor or StompMessageHeaderAccessor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/application-context-events.html)"
"How can you create and configure a WebSocketStompClient in Spring?","To create and configure a WebSocketStompClient in Spring, you can follow the example provided: WebSocketClient webSocketClient = new StandardWebSocketClient(); WebSocketStompClient stompClient = new WebSocketStompClient(webSocketClient); stompClient.setMessageConverter(new StringMessageConverter()); stompClient.setTaskScheduler(taskScheduler); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/client.html)"
"What is the purpose of the SockJsClient in Spring's STOMP over WebSocket client?","The SockJsClient in Spring's STOMP over WebSocket client can be used as an alternative to StandardWebSocketClient. It can use WebSocket or HTTP-based transport as a fallback. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/client.html)"
"How can you establish a connection and provide a handler for the STOMP session in Spring?","To establish a connection and provide a handler for the STOMP session in Spring, you can use the following example: String url = 'ws://127.0.0.1:8080/endpoint'; StompSessionHandler sessionHandler = new MyStompSessionHandler(); stompClient.connect(url, sessionHandler); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/client.html)"
"What is the purpose of the WebSocket scope in Spring Boot?","The WebSocket scope in Spring Boot allows you to declare a Spring-managed bean that is associated with a WebSocket session. This scope is useful for managing resources that are specific to a single WebSocket session, such as user-specific data or session-specific configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/scope.html)"
"How can you access the attributes of a WebSocket session in a Spring Boot controller?","To access the attributes of a WebSocket session in a Spring Boot controller, you can use the SimpMessageHeaderAccessor class. This class provides methods for retrieving the session attributes as a map. You can then use this map to access the attributes associated with the current WebSocket session. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/scope.html)"
"What is the difference between the 'target' and 'proxy' modes for WebSocket-scoped beans in Spring Boot?","The 'target' mode for WebSocket-scoped beans in Spring Boot refers to the actual instance of the bean that is stored in the WebSocket session attributes. The 'proxy' mode, on the other hand, creates a proxy object that delegates method calls to the actual bean instance. Using the 'proxy' mode allows you to inject WebSocket-scoped beans into other beans and have the proxy object automatically resolve the actual bean instance from the WebSocket session attributes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/scope.html)"
"What factors affect performance in a messaging application backed by thread pools?","The size and volume of messages, whether application methods perform work that requires blocking, and external factors (such as network speed and other issues) affect performance in a messaging application backed by thread pools. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/configuration-performance.html)"
"How is the thread pool size for the clientInboundChannel typically configured?","By default, the clientInboundChannel is configured at twice the number of available processors. If the handling of messages in annotated methods is mainly CPU-bound, the number of threads for the clientInboundChannel should remain close to the number of processors. If the work they do is more IO-bound and requires blocking or waiting on a database or other external system, the thread pool size probably needs to be increased. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/configuration-performance.html)"
"How can you configure how long a send is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered when sending messages to a client?","You can use the sendTimeLimit and sendBufferSizeLimit properties to configure how long a send is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered when sending messages to a client. The general idea is that, at any given time, only a single thread can be used to send to a client. All additional messages, meanwhile, get buffered, and you can use these properties to decide how long sending a message is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered in the meantime. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/configuration-performance.html)"
"What is the purpose of WebSocketMessageBrokerStats bean in Spring Boot?","The WebSocketMessageBrokerStats bean gathers all available information related to the monitoring of client WebSocket sessions and provides insight into the internal state of the application. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/stats.html)"
"What are the different types of sessions tracked by WebSocketMessageBrokerStats?","WebSocketMessageBrokerStats tracks three types of sessions: WebSocket sessions, HTTP streaming sessions, and polling SockJS sessions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/stats.html)"
"How can you view WebSocketMessageBrokerStats information in real-time?","You can view WebSocketMessageBrokerStats information in real-time by exporting the bean to JMX through Spring's MBeanExporter and using a tool like JDK's jconsole. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/stats.html)"
"What are the two main approaches to testing applications when using Spring's STOMP-over-WebSocket support?","The two main approaches are writing server-side tests to verify the functionality of controllers and their annotated message-handling methods, and writing full end-to-end tests that involve running a client and a server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/testing.html)"
"Which approach is more focused and easier to write and maintain?","Server-side tests are more focused and easier to write and maintain. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/testing.html)"
"What is the simplest form of server-side tests for controllers under test?","The simplest form of server-side tests is to write controller unit tests. However, this is not useful enough, since much of what a controller does depends on its annotations. Ideally, controllers under test should be invoked as they are at runtime, much like the approach to testing controllers that handle HTTP requests by using the Spring MVC Test framework — that is, without running a Servlet container but relying on the Spring Framework to invoke the annotated controllers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/websocket/stomp/testing.html)"
"What is the Web on Reactive Stack and what does it cover in the Spring Framework documentation?","The Web on Reactive Stack is a part of the Spring Framework documentation that covers support for reactive-stack web applications built on a Reactive Streams API to run on non-blocking servers. It includes chapters on the Spring WebFlux framework, the reactive WebClient, support for testing, and reactive libraries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html)"
"What are some examples of non-blocking servers supported by the Web on Reactive Stack?","The Web on Reactive Stack supports running on non-blocking servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html)"
"Where can I find information on Servlet-stack web applications in the Spring Framework documentation?","For information on Servlet-stack web applications, you can refer to the Web on Servlet Stack section of the Spring Framework documentation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html)"
"What is the purpose of Spring WebFlux?","Spring WebFlux is a reactive-stack web framework added to the Spring Framework in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on servers such as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html)"
"How do the Spring WebFlux and Spring Web MVC modules co-exist in the Spring Framework?","Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules (spring-webmvc and spring-webflux) and co-exist side by side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional, and applications can use one or the other module or both. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html)"
"What is the main difference between Spring WebFlux and Spring Web MVC?","Spring WebFlux is purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers, while Spring WebFlux is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on such servers as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html)"
"Why was Spring WebFlux created?","Spring WebFlux was created to address the need for a non-blocking web stack that can handle concurrency with a small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware resources. It was also created to take advantage of functional programming and the addition of lambda expressions in Java 8. The motivation for Spring WebFlux was to provide a new common API to serve as a foundation across any non-blocking runtime and to enable Spring to offer functional web endpoints alongside annotated controllers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/new-framework.html)"
"What does the term 'reactive' mean in the context of Spring WebFlux?","The term 'reactive' refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change. In the context of Spring WebFlux, it means that instead of being blocked, the application is now in the mode of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available. It also refers to non-blocking back pressure, which is a mechanism that controls the rate of events so that a fast producer does not overwhelm its destination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/new-framework.html)"
"What is the role of Reactive Streams in Spring WebFlux?","Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability in Spring WebFlux. It is a small spec that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure. It is of interest to libraries and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API because it is too low-level. Reactive Streams supports non-blocking back pressure and is adopted in Java 9. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/new-framework.html)"
"What is the purpose of HttpHandler in Spring WebFlux?","HttpHandler is a simple contract with a single method to handle a request and a response. It is intentionally minimal, and its main and only purpose is to be a minimal abstraction over different HTTP server APIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpHandler and WebHandler API in Spring WebFlux?","HttpHandler is a basic contract for HTTP request handling with non-blocking I/O and Reactive Streams back pressure, along with adapters for different servlet containers. WebHandler API is a slightly higher level, general-purpose web API for request handling, on top of which concrete programming models such as annotated controllers and functional endpoints are built. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html)"
"How can I configure buffer sizes for decoders and HttpMessageReaders in Spring WebFlux?","To configure buffer sizes, you can check if a given Decoder or HttpMessageReader exposes a maxInMemorySize property and if so the Javadoc will have details about default values. On the server side, ServerCodecConfigurer provides a single place from where to set all codecs. On the client side, the limit for all codecs can be changed in WebClient.Builder. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html)"
"What is the primary role of the DispatcherHandler in Spring WebFlux?","The DispatcherHandler is the central WebHandler in Spring WebFlux that provides a shared algorithm for request processing, while actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/dispatcher-handler.html)"
"What is the front controller pattern, and how does it relate to Spring WebFlux?","The front controller pattern is a design pattern where a central controller handles all requests. In Spring WebFlux, the DispatcherHandler is designed around this pattern. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/dispatcher-handler.html)"
"How does the DispatcherHandler discover the delegate components it needs?","The DispatcherHandler discovers the delegate components it needs from Spring configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/dispatcher-handler.html)"

"Can annotated controllers in Spring WebFlux extend base classes or implement specific interfaces?","No, annotated controllers in Spring WebFlux do not have to extend base classes nor implement specific interfaces. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller.html})"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestMapping annotation in Spring WebFlux?","The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map requests to controllers methods. It has various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"Can you explain the use of composed annotations in Spring WebFlux?","Composed annotations are annotations that are themselves meta-annotated with @RequestMapping and composed to redeclare a subset (or all) of the @RequestMapping attributes with a narrower, more specific purpose. For example, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping are examples of composed annotations. They are provided because, arguably, most controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method versus using @RequestMapping, which, by default, matches to all HTTP methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"How can you narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request in Spring WebFlux?","You can narrow the request mapping based on the Content-Type of the request by using the consumes attribute in the @PostMapping annotation. The consumes attribute also supports negation expressions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.html)"
"What is the purpose of @RequestMapping in Spring Boot?","The @RequestMapping annotation in Spring Boot is used to map HTTP requests to controller methods. It allows you to specify the URL pattern and HTTP method that a controller method should respond to. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods.html#mvc-ann-methods-requestmapping)"
"What types of arguments can be used in a @RequestMapping handler method?","A @RequestMapping handler method can accept a variety of arguments, including model attributes, session attributes, request parameters, header values, cookie values, and more. These arguments can be used to access data from the request or to pass data to the view. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods.html#mvc-ann-methods-arguments)"
"How can you return a JSON response from a @RequestMapping handler method?","To return a JSON response from a @RequestMapping handler method, you can use the @ResponseBody annotation and return a JSON object or a String that represents a JSON object. You can also use the Jackson library to automatically convert Java objects to JSON. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods.html#mvc-ann-methods-return-types-jackson)"
"What is the purpose of the ServerWebExchange method argument in Spring WebFlux controllers?","The ServerWebExchange method argument provides access to the full ServerWebExchange, which is a container for the HTTP request and response, request and session attributes, checkNotModified methods, and others. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/arguments.html)"
"How can I access the HTTP request or response in a Spring WebFlux controller method?","You can access the HTTP request or response by using the ServerHttpRequest or ServerHttpResponse method arguments, respectively.

"What are the different controller method return values supported in Spring WebFlux?","The supported controller method return values in Spring WebFlux include: @ResponseBody, HttpEntity<B>, ResponseEntity<B>, HttpHeaders, ErrorResponse, ProblemDetail, String, View, java.util.Map, org.springframework.ui.Model, @ModelAttribute, void, Flux<ServerSentEvent>, Observable<ServerSentEvent>, or other reactive type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux handle multiple values when returning a Flux?","When returning a Flux, elements are streamed as they come and are not buffered. This is the default behavior, as keeping a potentially large amount of elements in memory is not efficient. If the media type implies an infinite stream, values are written and flushed individually. Otherwise, values are written individually and the flushing happens separately. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"How can applications trade memory efficiency for better handling of errors when encoding elements to JSON in Spring WebFlux?","Applications can choose to buffer elements and encode them all at once by returning a Flux<List<B>>. Reactor provides a dedicated operator for that, Flux#collectList(). This allows for better handling of errors when encoding elements to JSON. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/return-types.html)"
"What types of arguments in annotated controller methods require type conversion?","String-based request input arguments such as @RequestParam, @RequestHeader, @PathVariable, @MatrixVariable, and @CookieValue require type conversion if they are declared as something other than String. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"How does Spring Boot handle type conversion for annotated controller method arguments?","Type conversion is automatically applied based on the configured converters. By default, simple types such as int, long, Date, and others are supported. Type conversion can be customized through a WebDataBinder or by registering Formatters with the FormattingConversionService. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"How does Spring Boot handle an empty String source value in type conversion?","An empty String source value is treated as missing if it becomes null as a result of type conversion. This can be the case for Long, UUID, and other target types. If you want to allow null to be injected, either use the required flag on the argument annotation or declare the argument as @Nullable. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/typeconversion.html)"
"What is the use of the @RequestParam annotation in Spring Boot?","The @RequestParam annotation is used to bind query parameters to a method argument in a controller. It can be used with both Java and Kotlin. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can I make a method parameter optional using @RequestParam?","You can make a method parameter optional by setting the required flag of a @RequestParam to false or by declaring the argument with a java.util.Optional wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"Can I use @RequestParam to access form data and multiparts?","No, @RequestParam only binds to query parameters. To access form data, multiparts, and query parameters, you can use data binding to apply them to a command object. In WebFlux, each is accessed individually through ServerWebExchange. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.html)"
"How can I bind a request header to a method argument in a Spring Boot controller?","You can use the @RequestHeader annotation. For example, to get the value of the Accept-Encoding header, you would use @RequestHeader(""Accept-Encoding"") String encoding. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.html)"
"Can I get the value of multiple headers in a single method argument?","Yes, if you use @RequestHeader on a Map<String, String>, MultiValueMap<String, String>, or HttpHeaders argument, the map will be populated with all header values. For example, @RequestHeader(""Accept"") String[] accepts will get an array of all Accept header values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.html)"
"Is there automatic type conversion for request header values?","Yes, type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not String. For example, if you have @RequestHeader(""Accept"") List<String> accepts, the Accept header value will be converted to a list of strings. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.html)"
"What annotation is used to bind the value of an HTTP cookie to a method argument in a Spring Boot controller?","@CookieValue (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.html)"
"How can you access the value of a cookie named 'JSESSIONID' in a Spring Boot controller method?","By using the @CookieValue annotation with the argument name 'JSESSIONID'. Example: @GetMapping(""/demo"") public void handle(@CookieValue(""JSESSIONID"") String cookie) { //... } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.html)"
"Is type conversion automatically applied when using the @CookieValue annotation in a Spring Boot controller?","Yes, type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not String. See Type Conversion(typeconversion.html). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring WebFlux?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring WebFlux is used to bind request parameters onto a model object. It can be used to bind to an instance of a specified class, which may be accessed from the model, HTTP session, or instantiated through a default or primary constructor. It is recommended to use an object tailored specifically for web binding or apply constructor binding only for security reasons. When using constructor binding, you can customize request parameter names through an @BindParam annotation. The @ModelAttribute argument can be declared with or without a reactive type wrapper, and data binding errors can be handled by adding a BindingResult argument or directly through a reactive type wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How can you apply validation after data binding in Spring WebFlux?","You can apply validation after data binding in Spring WebFlux by adding the jakarta.validation.Valid annotation or Spring's @Validated annotation. This allows for the automatic application of validation after data binding. The @Valid annotation can be used on a model attribute argument, and if method validation applies because other parameters have @Constraint annotations, then HandlerMethodValidationException would be raised instead. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux support reactive types in the model?","Spring WebFlux supports reactive types in the model, such as Mono<Account>. You can declare a @ModelAttribute argument with or without a reactive type wrapper, and it will be resolved accordingly to the actual value. If data binding results in errors, by default a WebExchangeBindException is raised, but you can also handle errors directly through the reactive type wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot?","The @SessionAttributes annotation is used to store model attributes in the WebSession between requests. It is a type-level annotation that declares session attributes used by a specific controller. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How does the @SessionAttributes annotation work in Spring Boot?","On the first request, when a model attribute with the name, pet, is added to the model, it is automatically promoted to and saved in the WebSession. It remains there until another controller method uses a SessionStatus method argument to clear the storage. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"How can I use the @SessionAttributes annotation in Spring Boot?","To use the @SessionAttributes annotation, you need to apply it to a controller class and list the names of model attributes or types of model attributes that should be transparently stored in the session for subsequent requests. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.html)"
"What annotation is used in Spring Boot to access pre-existing session attributes managed globally outside the controller?","@SessionAttribute (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattribute.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.html)"
"How can I use the @RequestAttribute annotation in a Spring Boot controller method?","To use the @RequestAttribute annotation in a Spring Boot controller method, you can add the annotation to a method parameter, as shown in the example: Java - @GetMapping(""/"") public String handle(@RequestAttribute Client client) { ... }, Kotlin - @GetMapping(""/"") fun handle(@RequestAttribute client: Client): String { ... }. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.html)"
"Can I use the @RequestAttribute annotation with different data types in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can use the @RequestAttribute annotation with different data types in Spring Boot. The data type should match the type of the request attribute you are accessing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.html)"
"How can you handle a file upload form in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can handle a file upload form in a Spring WebFlux controller by using data binding to a command object (modelattrib-method-args.html). The best way to handle a file upload form is through data binding to a command object, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin class MyForm { private String name; private MultipartFile file; // ... } @Controller public class FileUploadController { @PostMapping(""/form"") public String handleFormUpload(MyForm form, BindingResult errors) { // ... } } class MyForm( val name: String, val file: MultipartFile) @Controller class FileUploadController { @PostMapping(""/form"") fun handleFormUpload(form: MyForm, errors: BindingResult): String { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html)"
"How can you access individual parts with @RequestPart in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can access individual parts with @RequestPart in a Spring WebFlux controller by using the @RequestPart annotation. The following example shows how to use @RequestPart to get the metadata and file: Java Kotlin @PostMapping(""/"") public String handle(@RequestPart(""meta-data"") Part metadata, @RequestPart(""file-data"") FilePart file) { // ... } 1 Using @RequestPart to get the metadata. 2 Using @RequestPart to get the file. @PostMapping(""/"") fun handle(@RequestPart(""meta-data"") Part metadata, @RequestPart(""file-data"") FilePart file): String { // ... } 1 Using @RequestPart to get the metadata. 2 Using @RequestPart to get the file. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html)"
"How can you access all multipart data as a MultiValueMap in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can access all multipart data as a MultiValueMap in a Spring WebFlux controller by using @RequestBody. The following example shows how to use @RequestBody to access all multipart data as a MultiValueMap: Java Kotlin @PostMapping(""/"") public String handle(@RequestBody Mono<MultiValueMap<String, Part>> parts) { // ... } 1 Using @RequestBody. @PostMapping(""/"") fun handle(@RequestBody parts: MultiValueMap<String, Part>): String { // ... } 1 Using @RequestBody. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @RequestBody annotation in Spring WebFlux?","The @RequestBody annotation in Spring WebFlux is used to have the request body read and deserialized into an Object through an HttpMessageReader. It supports reactive types and fully non-blocking reading and (client-to-server) streaming. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"How can I configure or customize message readers in Spring WebFlux?","You can use the HTTP message codecs option of the WebFlux Config to configure or customize message readers in Spring WebFlux. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"Can I use the @RequestBody annotation in combination with bean validation in Spring WebFlux?","Yes, you can use the @RequestBody annotation in combination with jakarta.validation.Valid or Spring’s @Validated annotation in Spring WebFlux, which causes Standard Bean Validation to be applied. Validation errors cause a WebExchangeBindException, which results in a 400 (BAD_REQUEST) response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.html)"
"What is the difference between HttpEntity and @RequestBody in Spring Boot?","HttpEntity is more or less identical to using @RequestBody, but it is based on a container object that exposes request headers and the body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html)"
"How can I handle an HTTP POST request with an entity in Spring Boot?","You can handle an HTTP POST request with an entity in Spring Boot by using the @PostMapping annotation and a parameter of type HttpEntity. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'entity' parameter in the provided example?","The 'entity' parameter in the provided example represents an HttpEntity containing an Account object, which can be used to access the request headers and body. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.html)"
"What does the @ResponseBody annotation do in Spring Boot?","The @ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot allows the return value of a method to be serialized and sent as the response body through an HttpMessageWriter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"Can @ResponseBody be used at the class level?","@ResponseBody can be used at the class level, in which case it is inherited by all controller methods. This is the effect of @RestController, which is marked with both @Controller and @ResponseBody. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"Does @ResponseBody support reactive types?","@ResponseBody supports reactive types, meaning you can return Reactor or RxJava types and have the asynchronous values they produce rendered to the response. For more information, see Streaming and JSON rendering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responsebody.html)"
"What is the purpose of ResponseEntity in Spring Boot?","ResponseEntity is used to return a response with a specific status code and headers in Spring Boot. It is similar to @ResponseBody but provides additional control over the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How can I set an ETag header in a ResponseEntity in Spring Boot?","To set an ETag header in a ResponseEntity in Spring Boot, you can use the eTag() method when creating the ResponseEntity. For example: ResponseEntity.ok().eTag(etag).body(body); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How can I return an asynchronous response with ResponseEntity in Spring Boot WebFlux?","In Spring Boot WebFlux, you can return an asynchronous response with ResponseEntity by using reactive types such as Mono and Flux. You can use ResponseEntity<Mono<T>> or ResponseEntity<Flux<T>> to provide the response status and headers immediately while the body is provided asynchronously at a later point. You can also use Mono<ResponseEntity<T>> to provide all three - response status, headers, and body - asynchronously at a later point. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/responseentity.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux support Jackson's Serialization Views?","Spring WebFlux provides built-in support for Jackson's Serialization Views, which allows rendering only a subset of all fields in an Object. To use it with @ResponseBody or ResponseEntity controller methods, you can use Jackson’s @JsonView annotation to activate a serialization view class, as shown in the example above."
"What is the purpose of @JsonView annotation in the context of Spring WebFlux and Jackson?","@JsonView annotation in the context of Spring WebFlux and Jackson is used to activate a serialization view class, allowing you to render only a subset of all fields in an Object. It can be used with @ResponseBody or ResponseEntity controller methods."
"Can you use multiple views with the @JsonView annotation in Spring WebFlux?","Yes, you can use an array of view classes with the @JsonView annotation. However, you can specify only one view per controller method. If you need to activate multiple views, you can use a composite interface."
"What is the purpose of the @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring Boot?","The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring Boot can be used to create or access an Object from the model and to bind it to the request through a WebDataBinder. It can also be used to initialize the model prior to any @RequestMapping method invocation. This section discusses @ModelAttribute methods, which are invoked before @RequestMapping methods in the same controller and can be shared across controllers through @ControllerAdvice. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"How can you use a @ModelAttribute method to add one attribute only in Spring Boot?","To add one attribute only using a @ModelAttribute method in Spring Boot, you can declare a method with the @ModelAttribute annotation and return the attribute you want to add. The attribute will be added to the model with a default name based on the type, or you can assign an explicit name using the overloaded addAttribute method or through the name attribute on @ModelAttribute. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"How can you use a @ModelAttribute method to support reactive types in the model in Spring Boot?","To support reactive types in the model using a @ModelAttribute method in Spring Boot, you can declare a method with the @ModelAttribute annotation and return a reactive type (such as Mono<Account> or io.reactivex.Single<Account>). The reactive model attribute can be transparently resolved to its actual value at the time of @RequestMapping invocation, provided a @ModelAttribute argument is declared without a wrapper. In addition, any model attributes with a reactive type wrapper are resolved to their actual values just prior to view rendering. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot?","The @InitBinder annotation in Spring Boot is used to initialize WebDataBinder instances that can bind request parameters to a model object, convert request values from string to object property types, and format model object properties as strings when rendering HTML forms. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"How can you customize the conversion process for request parameters in Spring Boot?","You can customize the conversion process for request parameters in Spring Boot by registering PropertyEditor, Converter, and Formatter components in the DataBinder for type conversion. Alternatively, you can use the WebFlux config to register Converter and Formatter components in a globally shared FormattingConversionService. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"What is the difference between constructor binding and property binding in Spring Boot?","Constructor binding uses only the request parameters it needs for constructor arguments, and any other input is ignored. In contrast, property binding, by default, binds every request parameter for which there is a matching property. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.html)"
"How does Spring WebFlux handle validation for @RequestMapping methods?","Spring WebFlux has built-in validation for @RequestMapping methods, including Java Bean Validation. Validation may be applied at one of two levels: @ModelAttribute, @RequestBody, and @RequestPart argument resolvers validate a method argument individually if the method parameter is annotated with Jakarta @Valid or Spring’s @Validated, AND there is no Errors or BindingResult parameter immediately after, AND method validation is not needed. The exception raised in this case is WebExchangeBindException. When @Constraint annotations such as @Min, @NotBlank and others are declared directly on method parameters, or on the method (for the return value), then method validation must be applied, and that supersedes validation at the method argument level because method validation covers both method parameter constraints and nested constraints via @Valid. The exception raised in this case is HandlerMethodValidationException. Applications must handle both WebExchangeBindException and HandlerMethodValidationException as either may be raised depending on the controller method signature. The two exceptions, however, are designed to be very similar, and can be handled with almost identical code. The main difference is that the former is for a single object while the latter is for a list of method parameters. @Valid is not a constraint annotation, but rather for nested constraints within an Object. Therefore, by itself @Valid does not lead to method validation. @NotNull on the other hand is a constraint, and adding it to an @Valid parameter leads to method validation. For nullability specifically, you may also use the required flag of @RequestBody or @ModelAttribute. Method validation may be used in combination with Errors or BindingResult method parameters. However, the controller method is called only if all validation errors are on method parameters with an Errors immediately after. If there are validation errors on any other method parameter then HandlerMethodValidationException is raised. You can configure a Validator globally through the WebFlux config, or locally through an @InitBinder method in an @Controller or @ControllerAdvice. You can also use multiple validators. If a controller has a class level @Validated, then method validation is applied through an AOP proxy. In order to take advantage of the Spring MVC built-in support for method validation added in Spring Framework 6.1, you need to remove the class level @Validated annotation from the controller. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-validation.html)"
"How can I handle validation errors in Spring WebFlux?","You can handle validation errors in Spring WebFlux by extending ResponseEntityExceptionHandler or using an @ExceptionHandler method in a controller or in a @ControllerAdvice, and handling HandlerMethodValidationException directly. The exception contains a list of ParameterValidationResult that group validation errors by method parameter. You can either iterate over those, or provide a visitor with callback methods by controller method parameter type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-validation.html)"
"How can I configure a Validator for Spring WebFlux?","You can configure a Validator for Spring WebFlux globally through the WebFlux config, or locally through an @InitBinder method in an @Controller or @ControllerAdvice. You can also use multiple validators. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-validation.html)"
"How can I handle exceptions in a Spring WebFlux controller?","You can handle exceptions in a Spring WebFlux controller by declaring an @ExceptionHandler method in your @Controller or @ControllerAdvice class. The exception can match against a top-level exception being propagated or against the immediate cause within a top-level wrapper exception. Preferably, declare the target exception as a method argument. Alternatively, you can narrow the exception types to match in the annotation declaration. It is recommended to be as specific as possible in the argument signature and to declare your primary root exception mappings on a @ControllerAdvice prioritized with a corresponding order. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.html>)"
"What method arguments are supported in an @ExceptionHandler method in Spring WebFlux?","@ExceptionHandler methods in Spring WebFlux support the same method arguments as @RequestMapping methods, except the request body might have been consumed already. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.html>)"
"What return values are supported in an @ExceptionHandler method in Spring WebFlux?","@ExceptionHandler methods in Spring WebFlux support the same return values as @RequestMapping methods. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations in Spring Boot?","The @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations are used to declare methods that apply more globally across controllers, such as @ExceptionHandler, @InitBinder, and @ModelAttribute methods. The @ControllerAdvice annotation is annotated with @Component, which means that such classes can be registered as Spring beans through component scanning. The @RestControllerAdvice annotation is a composed annotation that is annotated with both @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody, which essentially means @ExceptionHandler methods are rendered to the response body through message conversion. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-advice.html)"
"How can you narrow down the scope of @ControllerAdvice methods to a subset of controllers?","You can use attributes on the @ControllerAdvice annotation to target specific controllers based on annotations, packages, or assignable types. For example, you can target all controllers annotated with @RestController, within specific packages, or assignable to specific classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-advice.html)"
"What is the difference between local and global @ExceptionHandler methods in Spring Boot?","Local @ExceptionHandler methods are declared within the @Controller class, while global @ExceptionHandler methods are declared in a class annotated with @ControllerAdvice. Global @ExceptionHandler methods are applied after local ones. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/controller/ann-advice.html)"
"What is the purpose of the UriComponentsBuilder class in Spring Framework?","The UriComponentsBuilder class in Spring Framework helps to build URIs from URI templates with variables. It provides various options to encode, expand, and build URIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/uri-building.html)"
"How can you configure RestTemplate and WebClient to customize the preparation of URIs in Spring Framework?","You can configure RestTemplate and WebClient with a UriBuilderFactory to customize the preparation of URIs. The DefaultUriBuilderFactory is a default implementation of UriBuilderFactory that uses UriComponentsBuilder internally and exposes shared configuration options. You can configure RestTemplate and WebClient with a UriBuilderFactory to customize the preparation of URIs. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/uri-building.html)"
"What are the different encoding modes available in DefaultUriBuilderFactory and how do they differ?","The DefaultUriBuilderFactory provides four encoding modes: TEMPLATE_AND_VALUES, VALUES_ONLY, URI_COMPONENT, and NONE. TEMPLATE_AND_VALUES encodes the URI template and strictly encodes URI variables when expanded, while VALUES_ONLY does not encode the URI template and strictly encodes URI variables. URI_COMPONENT encodes URI component value after URI variables are expanded, and NONE applies no encoding. The encoding mode can be set in DefaultUriBuilderFactory and used by RestTemplate and WebClient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/uri-building.html)"
"What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web development?","Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that lets you specify what kind of cross-domain requests are authorized, rather than using less secure and less powerful workarounds based on IFRAME or JSONP. It is used to enable a web application running at one origin to access selected resources from a different origin."
"How does Spring WebFlux handle CORS requests?","Spring WebFlux HandlerMapping implementations provide built-in support for CORS. After successfully mapping a request to a handler, a HandlerMapping checks the CORS configuration for the given request and handler and takes further actions. Preflight requests are handled directly, while simple and actual CORS requests are intercepted, validated, and have the required CORS response headers set."
"How can you enable CORS in the WebFlux Java configuration?","To enable CORS in the WebFlux Java configuration, you can use the CorsRegistry callback, as shown in the example. By default global configuration enables all origins, all headers, GET, HEAD, and POST methods, and allows credentials. You can customize these settings by adding mappings to the CorsRegistry."
"What is the main abstraction for the Spring Framework's support of the 'Problem Details for HTTP APIs' specification?","ProblemDetail — representation for an RFC 9457 problem detail; a simple container for both standard fields defined in the spec, and for non-standard ones. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can you extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields?","You can extend an RFC 9457 response with non-standard fields in one of two ways. One, insert into the ""properties"" Map of ProblemDetail. When using the Jackson library, the Spring Framework registers ProblemDetailJacksonMixin that ensures this ""properties"" Map is unwrapped and rendered as top level JSON properties in the response, and likewise any unknown property during deserialization is inserted into this Map. You can also extend ProblemDetail to add dedicated non-standard properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/ann-rest-exceptions.html)"
"How can a client application catch and handle error responses using the WebClient and RestTemplate in Spring WebFlux?","A client application can catch WebClientResponseException, when using the WebClient, or RestClientResponseException when using the RestTemplate, and use their getResponseBodyAs methods to decode the error response body to any target type such as ProblemDetail, or a subclass of ProblemDetail.

"What are some exploits that Spring Security helps protect against?","Spring Security helps protect against exploits such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and provides security response headers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/security.html)"
"What is the primary purpose of HTTP caching in a web application?","HTTP caching can significantly improve the performance of a web application. It revolves around the Cache-Control response header and subsequent conditional request headers, such as Last-Modified and ETag. Cache-Control advises private (for example, browser) and public (for example, proxy) caches how to cache and re-use responses. An ETag header is used to make a conditional request that may result in a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) without a body, if the content has not changed. ETag can be seen as a more sophisticated successor to the Last-Modified header. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/caching.html)"
"What is the purpose of the CacheControl class in Spring WebFlux?","CacheControl provides support for configuring settings related to the Cache-Control header and is accepted as an argument in a number of places: Controllers, Static Resources. While RFC 7234 describes all possible directives for the Cache-Control response header, the CacheControl type takes a use case-oriented approach that focuses on the common scenarios. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/caching.html)"
"How can a controller add explicit support for HTTP caching in Spring WebFlux?","A controller can add an ETag and Cache-Control settings to a ResponseEntity, as the following example shows:

```java
@GetMapping(""/book/{id}"")
public ResponseEntity<Book> showBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Book book = findBook(id);
    String version = book.getVersion();
    return ResponseEntity .ok() .cacheControl(CacheControl.maxAge(30, TimeUnit.DAYS)) .eTag(version) // lastModified is also available .body(book);
}
```
The preceding example sends a 304 (NOT_MODIFIED) response with an empty body if the comparison to the conditional request headers indicates the content has not changed. Otherwise, the ETag and Cache-Control headers are added to the response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/caching.html)"
"What are the view technologies integrated with Spring WebFlux?","Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, and others. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-view.html)"
"What is Thymeleaf and why is it useful?","Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine that emphasizes natural HTML templates that can be previewed in a browser by double-clicking, which is very helpful for independent work on UI templates (for example, by a designer) without the need for a running server. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-view.html)"
"How do I configure FreeMarker as a view technology in Spring WebFlux?","You can configure FreeMarker as a view technology by declaring a few beans, such as SpringResourceTemplateResolver, SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine, and ThymeleafReactiveViewResolver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-view.html)"
"How do you enable WebFlux in Java configuration?","You can use the @EnableWebFlux annotation in your Java config, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin @Configuration @EnableWebFlux public class WebConfig { } @Configuration @EnableWebFlux class WebConfig (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/config.html#_enabling_webflux_config)"
"How do you customize the global Validator instance in Java configuration?","In your Java configuration, you can customize the global Validator instance, as the following example shows: Java Kotlin @Configuration @EnableWebFlux public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer { @Override public Validator getValidator() { // ... } } @Configuration @EnableWebFlux class WebConfig : WebFluxConfigurer { override fun getValidator(): Validator { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/config.html#_validation)"
"How do you configure content type resolution in WebFlux Java configuration?","You can configure how Spring WebFlux determines the requested media types for @Controller instances from the request. By default, only the Accept header is checked, but you can also enable a query parameter-based strategy. The following example shows how to customize the requested content type resolution: Java Kotlin @Configuration @EnableWebFlux public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer { @Override public void configureContentTypeResolver(RequestedContentTypeResolverBuilder builder) { // ... } } @Configuration @EnableWebFlux class WebConfig : WebFluxConfigurer { override fun configureContentTypeResolver(builder: RequestedContentTypeResolverBuilder) { // ... } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/config.html#_content_type_resolvers)"

Its key features include being fully non-blocking, supporting streaming, and relying on the same codecs used on the server side. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)"
"Which HTTP client libraries does WebClient support out of the box?","WebClient supports Reactor Netty, JDK HttpClient, Jetty Reactive HttpClient, and Apache HttpComponents out of the box. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)"
"How can you customize the HTTP client library used by WebClient?","You can customize the HTTP client library used by WebClient by plugging in other libraries via the ClientHttpConnector. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient.html)"
"How can the retrieve() method be used in Spring WebClient to declare how to extract the response?","The retrieve() method in Spring WebClient can be used to declare how to extract the response. This can be done by using methods like toEntity(), bodyToMono(), or bodyToFlux(), depending on whether you want to get the entire response entity, the body only, or a stream of decoded objects, respectively. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-retrieve.html)"
"How can you customize the handling of error responses in Spring WebClient using the retrieve() method?","To customize the handling of error responses in Spring WebClient, you can use the onStatus handlers within the retrieve() method. This allows you to specify custom behavior for specific HTTP status codes, such as 4xx client errors and 5xx server errors. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-retrieve.html)"
"What are the different ways to extract the body of a response using the retrieve() method in Spring WebClient?","There are several ways to extract the body of a response using the retrieve() method in Spring WebClient. You can use bodyToMono() to get a Mono containing the decoded body, or bodyToFlux() to get a Flux of decoded objects if the response is a stream of events. Additionally, you can use awaitBody() in Kotlin to get the body as a single value. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-retrieve.html)"
"What are the `exchangeToMono()` and `exchangeToFlux()` methods used for in Spring WebFlux?","These methods are used for more advanced cases that require more control, such as to decode the response differently depending on the response status. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-exchange.html)"
"How can I decode the response differently depending on the response status using `exchangeToMono()` or `exchangeToFlux()`?","You can use a function that takes a `ServerResponse` as input and returns a `Mono` or `Flux` of the desired type. Inside this function, you can check the status code of the response and decode the body accordingly. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-exchange.html)"
"What happens to the response body after the returned Mono or Flux completes when using `exchangeToMono()` or `exchangeToFlux()`?","The response body is checked and if not consumed, it is released to prevent memory and connection leaks. Therefore, the response cannot be decoded further downstream. It is up to the provided function to declare how to decode the response if needed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-exchange.html)"
"How can I register a client filter (ExchangeFilterFunction) in Spring WebClient?","You can register a client filter (ExchangeFilterFunction) through the WebClient.Builder in order to intercept and modify requests. This can be done using the filter method in the WebClient.Builder class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-filter.html)"
"What is the purpose of client filters in Spring WebClient?","Client filters in Spring WebClient are used for cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication. They can be used to intercept and modify requests and responses. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-filter.html)"
"How can I add or remove filters from an existing WebClient instance?","Filters can be added or removed by mutating an existing WebClient instance using the mutate() method. This will result in a new WebClient instance that does not affect the original one. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-filter.html)"
"How can you pass information through the filter chain in Spring WebFlux?","You can pass information through the filter chain by adding attributes to a request. This is convenient if you want to influence the behavior of filters for a given request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"What is the purpose of adding attributes to a request in Spring WebFlux?","The purpose of adding attributes to a request in Spring WebFlux is to pass information through the filter chain and influence the behavior of filters for a given request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"How can you configure a defaultRequest callback globally at the WebClient.Builder level in Spring WebFlux?","You can configure a defaultRequest callback globally at the WebClient.Builder level by using the filter method. This allows you to insert attributes into all requests, which could be used for example in a Spring MVC application to populate request attributes based on ThreadLocal data. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"How can I pass information to the filter chain in Spring WebClient?","You can use client-attributes to pass information to the filter chain in Spring WebClient. This information only influences the current request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-attributes.html)"
"What is the difference between using client-attributes and Reactor Context in Spring WebClient?","Client-attributes provide a convenient way to pass information to the filter chain but only influence the current request. Reactor Context, on the other hand, allows you to pass information that propagates to additional requests, such as nested requests or requests executed after concatMap. Reactor Context needs to be populated at the end of a reactive chain to apply to all operations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-context.html)"
"How do I populate the Reactor Context in Spring WebClient to apply to all operations?","To populate the Reactor Context in Spring WebClient and apply it to all operations, you need to use the contextWrite method. For example: client.get().uri('https://example.org/').retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class).flatMap(body -> { // perform nested request (context propagates automatically)... }).contextWrite(context -> context.put('foo', ...)); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-context.html)"
"How can WebClient be used in synchronous style in Spring WebFlux?","WebClient can be used in synchronous style by blocking at the end for the result. The following example demonstrates how to do this in Java and Kotlin: Java: Person person = client.get().uri('/person/{id}', i).retrieve() .bodyToMono(Person.class).block(); List<Person> persons = client.get().uri('/persons').retrieve() .bodyToFlux(Person.class).collectList().block(); Kotlin: val person = runBlocking { client.get().uri('/person/{id}', i).retrieve() .awaitBody<Person>() } val persons = runBlocking { client.get().uri('/persons').retrieve() .bodyToFlow<Person>().toList() } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-synchronous.html)"
"What is the advantage of avoiding blocking on each response individually in Spring WebFlux?","Avoiding blocking on each response individually in Spring WebFlux is more efficient, especially when multiple calls need to be made. By waiting for the combined result, you can avoid potential performance issues caused by blocking. The following example demonstrates how to do this in Java and Kotlin: Java: Mono<Person> personMono = client.get().uri('/person/{id}', personId).retrieve().bodyToMono(Person.class); Mono<List<Hobby>> hobbiesMono = client.get().uri('/person/{id}/hobbies', personId).retrieve().bodyToFlux(Hobby.class).collectList(); Map<String, Object> data = Mono.zip(personMono, hobbiesMono, (person, hobbies) -> { Map<String, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>(); map.put('person', person); map.put('hobbies', hobbies); return map; }).block(); Kotlin: val data = runBlocking { val personDeferred = async { client.get().uri('/person/{id}', personId).retrieve().awaitBody<Person>() } val hobbiesDeferred = async { client.get().uri('/person/{id}/hobbies', personId).retrieve().bodyToFlow<Hobby>().toList() } mapOf('person' to personDeferred.await(), 'hobbies' to hobbiesDeferred.await()) } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-synchronous.html)"
"What should you never have to do in a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux controller when using Flux or Mono?","You should never have to block in a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux controller when using Flux or Mono. Instead, you should simply return the resulting reactive type from the controller method. The same principle applies to Kotlin Coroutines and Spring WebFlux, just use suspending functions or return Flow in your controller method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-synchronous.html)"
"How can I test code that uses the WebClient in Spring Boot?","You can use a mock web server, such as the OkHttp MockWebServer (https://github.com/square/okhttp#mockwebserver). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-webclient/client-testing.html)"
"Where can I find an example of using the OkHttp MockWebServer with WebClient in Spring Boot?","You can check out the WebClientIntegrationTests in the Spring Framework test suite (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/main/spring-webflux/src/test/java/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClientIntegrationTests.java) or the static-server sample in the OkHttp repository (https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/samples/static-server).

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-http-interface-client.html)"
"What is the WebSocket protocol and how does it differ from HTTP?","The WebSocket protocol is a standardized way to establish a full-duplex, two-way communication channel between client and server over a single TCP connection. It is designed to work over HTTP, using ports 80 and 443 and allowing re-use of existing firewall rules. A WebSocket interaction begins with an HTTP request that uses the HTTP Upgrade header to upgrade or, in this case, to switch to the WebSocket protocol. Unlike HTTP, WebSocket is a low-level transport protocol that does not prescribe any semantics to the content of messages. This means that there is no way to route or process a message unless the client and the server agree on message semantics. WebSocket clients and servers can negotiate the use of a higher-level, messaging protocol (for example, STOMP), through the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header on the HTTP handshake request. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-websocket.html)"
"How can you create a WebSocket server using the Spring Framework?","To create a WebSocket server using the Spring Framework, you can first create a WebSocketHandler. The following example shows how to do so:<br><br>Java<br><br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketHandler;<br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketSession;<br><br>public class MyWebSocketHandler implements WebSocketHandler {<br>  @Override<br>  public Mono<Void> handle(WebSocketSession session) {<br>    // ...<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Kotlin<br><br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketHandler<br>import org.springframework.web.reactive.socket.WebSocketSession<br><br>class MyWebSocketHandler : WebSocketHandler {<br>  override fun handle(session: WebSocketSession): Mono<Void> {<br>    // ...<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Then you can map it to a URL:<br><br>Java<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  @Bean<br>  public HandlerMapping handlerMapping() {<br>    Map<String, WebSocketHandler> map = new HashMap<>();<br>    map.put(&quot;/path&quot;, new MyWebSocketHandler());<br>    int order = -1; // before annotated controllers<br>    return new SimpleUrlHandlerMapping(map, order);<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Kotlin<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  @Bean<br>  fun handlerMapping(): HandlerMapping {<br>    val map = mapOf(&quot;/path&quot; to MyWebSocketHandler())<br>    val order = -1 // before annotated controllers<br>    return SimpleUrlHandlerMapping(map, order)<br>  }<br>}<br><br>If using the WebFlux Config, there is nothing further to do, or otherwise if not using the WebFlux config, you’ll need to declare a WebSocketHandlerAdapter as shown below:<br><br>Java<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  // ...<br>  @Bean<br>  public WebSocketHandlerAdapter handlerAdapter() {<br>    return new WebSocketHandlerAdapter();<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Kotlin<br><br>@Configuration<br>class WebConfig {<br>  // ...<br>  @Bean<br>  fun handlerAdapter() = WebSocketHandlerAdapter()<br>}<br><br>WebSocketHandler: The handle method of WebSocketHandler takes WebSocketSession and returns Mono<Void> to indicate when application handling of the session is complete. The session is handled through two streams, one for inbound and one for outbound messages. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-websocket.html)"

"What is the primary purpose of the RSocket protocol?","The RSocket protocol is designed for multiplexed, duplex communication over TCP, WebSocket, and other byte stream transports, using one of the following interaction models: Request-Response, Request-Stream, Channel, and Fire-and-Forget. Its main feature is that it allows for reactive streams semantics across the network boundary and supports back pressure signaling between requester and responder. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html)"
"How does RSocket handle connection resumption and back pressure?","RSocket supports session resumption, which is designed for loss of connectivity and requires some state to be maintained. The state management is transparent for applications, and works well in combination with back pressure which can stop a producer when possible and reduce the amount of state required. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html)"
"What is the role of RSocketStrategies in RSocketRequester configuration?","RSocketStrategies is used to configure an RSocketRequester. It allows you to provide encoders and decoders for (de)-serialization of data and metadata values, and is designed for re-use. In some scenarios, it may be preferable to declare it in Spring configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/rsocket.html)"
"What is the main purpose of reactor-core in Spring WebFlux?","Reactor-core is used internally by Spring WebFlux to compose asynchronous logic and provide Reactive Streams support. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux-reactive-libraries.html)"
"How does WebFlux handle different Reactive Streams Publisher implementations?","WebFlux treats a provided Publisher as a stream with unknown semantics (0..N).

"Which section of the reference documentation covers Spring Framework's support for caching using a cache abstraction?","The section is called 'Cache Abstraction' (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration.html)"
"How can I create a custom RestClient in Spring Boot?","To create a custom RestClient in Spring Boot, you can use the builder() method to get a builder with further options such as specifying which HTTP library to use and which message converters to use. You can then use the builder to set the desired options and create the RestClient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-restclient)"
"How can I convert JSON to objects using RestClient in Spring Boot?","To convert JSON to objects using RestClient in Spring Boot, you can use the body(Class) method to convert the response contents into various types, such as bytes to a String, JSON to objects using Jackson, and so on. You can also use the accept(MediaType…) method to set the Accept header to application/json. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-restclient)"
"How can I handle errors when using RestClient in Spring Boot?","To handle errors when using RestClient in Spring Boot, you can use the onStatus(HttpStatusCode::is4xxClientError, (request, response) -> { throw new MyCustomRuntimeException(response.getStatusCode(), response.getHeaders()); }) method to set up a status handler for all 4xx status codes and throw a custom exception.

"What is the purpose of the JmsTransactionManager class in Spring's JMS support?","The JmsTransactionManager class is an implementation of Spring's PlatformTransactionManager for JMS, allowing for seamless integration of JMS as a transactional resource into Spring's transaction management mechanisms. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JmsTemplate class in Spring's JMS components?","The JmsTemplate class is the central class in the JMS core package. It simplifies the use of JMS, since it handles the creation and release of resources when sending or synchronously receiving messages. Code that uses the JmsTemplate needs only to implement callback interfaces that give them a clearly defined high-level contract. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/using.html)"
"What is the default acknowledgment mode for messages in JmsTemplate, and what are the potential issues with using this mode?","The default acknowledgment mode for messages in JmsTemplate is AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE. This mode does not provide proper reliability guarantees. Messages can get lost when listener execution fails (since the provider automatically acknowledges each message after listener invocation, with no exceptions to be propagated to the provider) or when the listener container shuts down (you can configure this by setting the acceptMessagesWhileStopping flag). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/using.html)"
"What are the differences between SimpleMessageListenerContainer and DefaultMessageListenerContainer in Spring's JMS components?","SimpleMessageListenerContainer is the simpler of the two standard flavors. It creates a fixed number of JMS sessions and consumers at startup, registers the listener by using the standard JMS MessageConsumer.setMessageListener() method, and leaves it up the JMS provider to perform listener callbacks. This variant does not allow for dynamic adaption to runtime demands or for participation in externally managed transactions. DefaultMessageListenerContainer allows for dynamic adaptation to runtime demands and is able to participate in externally managed transactions. Each received message is registered with an XA transaction when configured with a JtaTransactionManager. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/using.html)"
"How can you send a message using the JmsTemplate in Spring Boot?","The JmsTemplate contains many convenience methods to send a message. Send methods specify the destination by using a jakarta.jms.Destination object, and others specify the destination by using a String in a JNDI lookup. The send method that takes no destination argument uses the default destination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/sending.html)"
"How can you use MessageConverters in the JmsTemplate to send domain model objects?","The JmsTemplate has various send methods that take a Java object as an argument for a message's data content. The overloaded methods convertAndSend() and receiveAndConvert() methods in JmsTemplate delegate the conversion process to an instance of the MessageConverter interface. The default implementation (SimpleMessageConverter) supports conversion between String and TextMessage, byte[] and BytesMessage, and java.util.Map and MapMessage. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/sending.html)"
"How can you modify a message header and property after a java.util.Map is converted to a message using the JmsTemplate?","You can use the MessagePostProcessor interface to modify a message header and property after a java.util.Map is converted to a message. The following example shows how to modify a message header and a property after a java.util.Map is converted to a message. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/sending.html)"
"What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous reception in JMS with Spring?","Synchronous reception in JMS with Spring involves the calling thread blocking until a message becomes available, which can potentially be blocked indefinitely. Asynchronous reception, on the other hand, uses Message-Driven POJOs (MDPs) that act as receivers for JMS messages and can be implemented through the @JmsListener annotation. This is the most convenient way to setup an asynchronous receiver. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/receiving.html)"
"What is the SessionAwareMessageListener interface and how is it used in Spring's asynchronous messaging support?","The SessionAwareMessageListener interface is a Spring-specific interface that provides a similar contract to the JMS MessageListener interface but also gives the message-handling method access to the JMS Session from which the Message was received. It can be used by MDPs if they want to respond to any received messages. All of the message listener container implementations that ship with Spring have support for MDPs that implement either the MessageListener or SessionAwareMessageListener interface. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/receiving.html)"
"What is the MessageListenerAdapter class and how is it used in Spring's asynchronous messaging support?","The MessageListenerAdapter class is a component in Spring's asynchronous messaging support that lets you expose almost any class as an MDP. It can automatically send back a response message if a handler method returns a non-void value. It can also automatically convert the return value into a TextMessage and send it to the Destination defined in the JMS Reply-To property of the original Message or the default Destination set on the MessageListenerAdapter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/receiving.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JmsMessageEndpointManager in Spring's JCA-based MessageListener container?","The JmsMessageEndpointManager is used to manage the lifecycle of a message listener and to provide a way to interact with the server-hosted ResourceAdapter. It is typically used with the JCA-based MessageListener container provided by Spring starting from version 2.5.

"How can you configure the target ResourceAdapter locally using Spring's ResourceAdapterFactoryBean?","You can configure the target ResourceAdapter locally using Spring's ResourceAdapterFactoryBean by setting the resourceAdapter property to a bean of the appropriate ResourceAdapter class and the workManager property to a bean of the SimpleTaskWorkManager class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/jca-message-endpoint-manager.html)"
"What is the difference between JmsActivationSpecConfig and a given ActivationSpec object in the JmsMessageEndpointManager?","JmsActivationSpecConfig is a generic configuration class provided by Spring for setting up the ActivationSpec object used by the JmsMessageEndpointManager. A given ActivationSpec object can also be used, and may come from a JNDI lookup. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/jca-message-endpoint-manager.html)"
"How can you receive a message asynchronously in Spring Boot using JMS?","You can use the annotated listener endpoint infrastructure. The @JmsListener annotation is used to expose a method of a managed bean as a JMS listener endpoint. The infrastructure creates a message listener container behind the scenes for each annotated method, by using a JmsListenerContainerFactory."
"How do you enable support for @JmsListener annotations in Spring Boot?","You can add @EnableJms to one of your @Configuration classes. By default, the infrastructure looks for a bean named jmsListenerContainerFactory as the source for the factory to use to create message listener containers."
"What is the purpose of the JmsListenerConfigurer interface in Spring Boot?","It allows you to customize the listener container factory to use for each annotation or you can configure an explicit default by implementing the JmsListenerConfigurer interface. The default is required only if at least one endpoint is registered without a specific container factory."
"What is the purpose of referencing the JMS schema in Spring?","Referencing the JMS schema in Spring is necessary to use the JMS namespace elements for simplifying JMS configuration. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/namespace.html)"
"What are the three top-level elements in the JMS namespace?","The three top-level elements in the JMS namespace are <annotation-driven/>, <listener-container/>, and <jca-listener-container/>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/namespace.html)"
"What is the purpose of the <listener-container/> element in the JMS namespace?","The <listener-container/> element in the JMS namespace defines shared listener container configuration and can contain <listener/> child elements. It allows for customization of various strategies and basic JMS settings and resource references. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jms/namespace.html)"
"What is JMX and what are its features in Spring?","JMX stands for Java Management Extensions. It is a specification that allows you to monitor and manage resources in a Java application. In Spring, JMX provides features such as automatic registration of Spring beans as JMX MBeans, controlling the management interface of beans, exposure of MBeans over remote connectors, and proxying of local and remote MBean resources. These features are designed to work without coupling your application components to Spring or JMX interfaces and classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx.html)"
"How can you control the management interface of beans in Spring using JMX?","In Spring, you can control the management interface of your beans using a flexible mechanism provided by JMX. This mechanism allows you to define the attributes, operations, and notifications that are exposed to the JMX infrastructure. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx.html)"
"What is the purpose of exposing MBeans over remote connectors in Spring using JMX?","Exposing MBeans over remote connectors in Spring using JMX allows you to manage and monitor your Spring application from a remote location. This is achieved through the use of JSR-160 connectors, which provide a standard way to communicate with remote resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx.html)"
"What is the core class in Spring's JMX framework responsible for registering Spring beans with a JMX MBeanServer?","MBeanExporter (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/exporting.html)"
"How can you configure an instance of the MBeanExporter class to expose the properties and methods of a bean as attributes and operations of an MBean?","By passing the bean into the beans property of the MBeanExporter configuration. The default configuration uses the bean's ObjectName as the key in the beans Map. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/exporting.html)"
"What is the default registration behavior when an MBeanExporter attempts to register an MBean with an MBeanServer and an MBean instance has already been registered under the same ObjectName?","The default registration behavior is FAIL_ON_EXISTING, which means the MBean that is being registered is not registered, and an InstanceAlreadyExistsException is thrown. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/exporting.html)"
"How can you control the management interface of your beans in Spring JMX?","You can control the management interface of your beans in Spring JMX by using the MBeanInfoAssembler interface. This interface is responsible for defining the management interface of each bean that is exposed. The default implementation, org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.SimpleReflectiveMBeanInfoAssembler, defines a management interface that exposes all public properties and methods. Spring provides two additional implementations of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface: MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler and InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler."
"What is the MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler and how can it be used?","The MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler is one of the additional implementations of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface provided by Spring JMX. It allows you to control the generated management interface by using source-level metadata. The reading of metadata is encapsulated by the org.springframework.jmx.export.metadata.JmxAttributeSource interface. The MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler must be configured with an implementation instance of the JmxAttributeSource interface for it to function correctly. To mark a bean for export to JMX, you should annotate the bean class with the ManagedResource annotation. You must mark each method you wish to expose as an operation with the ManagedOperation annotation and mark each property you wish to expose with the ManagedAttribute annotation."
"What is the InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler and how can it be used?","The InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler is another additional implementation of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface provided by Spring JMX. It lets you constrain the methods and properties that are exposed based on the set of methods defined in a collection of interfaces. This interface is used to define a management interface for the bean, and it is not required for the bean to implement the interface used to generate the JMX management interface. The InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler can be configured to use a specific interface or multiple interfaces for different beans. It also removes the need for naming conventions and the need for beans to implement MBean interfaces."
"How can you have Spring JMX create, start, and expose a JSR-160 JMXConnectorServer?","You can use the following configuration: <bean id=""serverConnector"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.support.ConnectorServerFactoryBean""/> By default, ConnectorServerFactoryBean creates a JMXConnectorServer bound to service:jmx:jmxmp://localhost:9875. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/jsr160.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ObjectName property in the ConnectorServerFactoryBean?","If the ObjectName property is set, Spring automatically registers your connector with the MBeanServer under that ObjectName. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/jsr160.html)"
"How can you create an MBeanServerConnection to a remote JSR-160-enabled MBeanServer?","You can use the MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean, as the following example shows: <bean id=""clientConnector"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.support.MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean""><property name=""serviceUrl"" value=""service:jmx:rmi://localhost/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi""/></bean>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/jsr160.html)"
"How can I create a proxy for an MBean running in a local MBeanServer using Spring JMX?","You can create a proxy for an MBean running in a local MBeanServer using Spring JMX by using the MBeanProxyFactoryBean class. The proxy is configured with the objectName and proxyInterface properties. The objectName property specifies the ObjectName of the MBean to proxy, and the proxyInterface property specifies the interface that the proxy implements. The following code shows an example of how to configure a proxy for an MBean running in a local MBeanServer: <bean id=""proxy"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.access.MBeanProxyFactoryBean""> <property name=""objectName"" value=""bean:name=testBean""/> <property name=""proxyInterface"" value=""org.springframework.jmx.IJmxTestBean""/> </bean>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/proxy.html)"
"How can I create a proxy for an MBean running on a remote machine using Spring JMX?","To create a proxy for an MBean running on a remote machine using Spring JMX, you need to create an MBeanServerConnection that points to the remote machine using the MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean. This MBeanServerConnection is then passed to the MBeanProxyFactoryBean through the server property. The following code shows an example of how to create a proxy for an MBean running on a remote machine: <bean id=""clientConnector"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.support.MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean""> <property name=""serviceUrl"" value=""service:jmx:rmi://remotehost:9875""/> </bean> <bean id=""proxy"" class=""org.springframework.jmx.access.MBeanProxyFactoryBean""> <property name=""objectName"" value=""bean:name=testBean""/> <property name=""proxyInterface"" value=""org.springframework.jmx.IJmxTestBean""/> <property name=""server"" ref=""clientConnector""/> </bean>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/proxy.html)"
"What is the purpose of the proxyInterfaces property in the MBeanProxyFactoryBean class?","The proxyInterfaces property in the MBeanProxyFactoryBean class controls the set of interfaces that the proxy implements. This property is used to specify the interfaces that the proxy implements, and the rules for mapping methods and properties on these interfaces to operations and attributes on the MBean are the same rules used by the InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/proxy.html)"
"How can I register a NotificationListener with an MBean in Spring's JMX support?","You can register a NotificationListener with an MBean in Spring's JMX support by using the notificationListenerMappings property of the MBeanExporter bean. This property is a map that allows you to associate a NotificationListener with an MBean. You can also use straight bean names as the link between exported beans and listeners. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/notifications.html)"
"What is the purpose of the NotificationPublisher interface in Spring's JMX support?","The NotificationPublisher interface in Spring's JMX support is used to publish notifications. Any bean that is going to be exported as an MBean through an MBeanExporter instance can implement the related NotificationPublisherAware interface to gain access to a NotificationPublisher instance. The NotificationPublisherAware interface supplies an instance of a NotificationPublisher to the implementing bean through a simple setter method, which the bean can then use to publish notifications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/notifications.html)"
"How can I register a NotificationListener for all MBeans exported by an MBeanExporter in Spring's JMX support?","To register a NotificationListener for all MBeans exported by an MBeanExporter in Spring's JMX support, you can use the special wildcard (*) as the key for an entry in the notificationListenerMappings property map. This will register the specified NotificationListener for all MBeans exported by the MBeanExporter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/jmx/notifications.html)"

"What is the name of the hierarchy of checked exceptions that provide a higher level of abstraction over the lower level mail system exceptions in the Spring Framework's email support?","The hierarchy of checked exceptions that provide a higher level of abstraction over the lower level mail system exceptions in the Spring Framework's email support is MailException. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/email.html)"
"What is the purpose of the TaskExecutor and TaskScheduler interfaces in Spring Framework?","The TaskExecutor and TaskScheduler interfaces in Spring Framework provide abstractions for the asynchronous execution and scheduling of tasks, respectively. They support thread pools and delegation to CommonJ within an application server environment, abstracting away the differences between Java SE and Jakarta EE environments. Spring also features integration classes to support scheduling with the Quartz Scheduler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html)"
"What is the difference between a fixed-rate and a fixed-delay trigger in the Spring TaskScheduler Abstraction?","A fixed-rate trigger measures the period between the successive start times of each invocation, while a fixed-delay trigger measures the period from the completion time of each preceding invocation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html)"
"How can you manage exceptions in an @Async method with a void return type?","To manage exceptions in an @Async method with a void return type, you can provide an AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler. By default, the exception is logged, but you can define a custom AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/scheduling.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework?","The Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework allows for the consistent use of various caching solutions with minimal impact on the code. It was introduced in version 3.1 and significantly extended in version 4.1 with support for JSR-107 annotations and more customization options. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html)"
"How can I add caching to an existing Spring application using the Cache Abstraction?","You can add caching to an existing Spring application using the Cache Abstraction by following the steps outlined in the 'Declarative Annotation-based Caching' and 'Declarative XML-based Caching' sections of the Spring Framework reference documentation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html)"
"What are some customization options available for the Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework?","The Cache Abstraction in the Spring Framework offers various customization options, including support for JSR-107 annotations, configuring the cache storage, plugging in different back-end caches, and setting the TTL/TTI/Eviction policy/XXX feature. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html)"
"What is the traditional use of a buffer in computing?","The traditional use of a buffer in computing is to serve as an intermediate temporary store for data between a fast and a slow entity. It helps to alleviate performance issues by allowing entire blocks of data to move at once rather than in small chunks. The data is written and read only once from the buffer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/strategies.html)"
"How does the cache abstraction in Spring Boot improve the performance of Java methods?","The cache abstraction in Spring Boot improves the performance of Java methods by applying caching to them, reducing the number of executions based on the information available in the cache. Each time a targeted method is invoked, the abstraction applies a caching behavior that checks whether the method has been already invoked for the given arguments. If it has been invoked, the cached result is returned without having to invoke the actual method. If the method has not been invoked, then it is invoked, and the result is cached and returned to the user so that, the next time the method is invoked, the cached result is returned. This way, expensive methods (whether CPU- or IO-bound) can be invoked only once for a given set of parameters and the result reused without having to actually invoke the method again. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/strategies.html)"
"What are the cache-related operations provided by the caching abstraction in Spring Boot?","The caching abstraction in Spring Boot provides other cache-related operations, such as the ability to update the content of the cache or to remove one or all entries. These operations are useful if the cache deals with data that can change during the course of the application. The caching abstraction also provides the ability to identify the methods that need to be cached and their policies, and to configure the backing cache where the data is stored and from which it is read. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/strategies.html)"
"How does Spring's caching abstraction provide a set of Java annotations for caching declaration?","Spring's caching abstraction provides a set of Java annotations for caching declaration, including @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, @Caching, and @CacheConfig. These annotations are used to trigger cache population, eviction, and updates, as well as to share common cache-related settings at the class level. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/annotations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Cacheable annotation in Spring's caching abstraction?","The @Cacheable annotation in Spring's caching abstraction triggers cache population. It is used to demarcate methods that are cacheable, meaning that the result of the method is stored in the cache so that subsequent invocations with the same arguments can return the value from the cache without having to invoke the method again. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/annotations.html)"
"How can you specify how the key is generated for a method annotated with @Cacheable?","To specify how the key is generated for a method annotated with @Cacheable, you can use the key attribute of the annotation. You can use Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to pick the arguments of interest, perform operations, or even invoke arbitrary methods without having to write any code or implement any interface. This approach is recommended over the default generator, as it allows for more flexibility and customization. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/annotations.html)"
"What are the JCache (JSR-107) annotations supported by Spring's caching abstraction since version 4.1?","@CacheResult, @CachePut, @CacheRemove, and @CacheRemoveAll as well as the @CacheDefaults, @CacheKey, and @CacheValue companions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/jsr-107.html)"
"Can you use JSR-107 annotations without migrating your cache store to JSR-107?","Yes, you can use these annotations even without migrating your cache store to JSR-107. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/jsr-107.html)"
"What is the main difference between the Spring @Cacheable annotation and the JSR-107 @CacheResult annotation?","The main difference is that @CacheResult can cache specific exceptions and force the execution of the method regardless of the content of the cache. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/jsr-107.html)"
"What is an alternative to annotation-based caching in Spring Boot?","Declarative XML-based caching is an alternative to annotation-based caching in Spring Boot. This approach allows you to specify the target method and caching directives externally, similar to declarative transaction management advice. It's useful when you have no access to the sources or no external code. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/declarative-xml.html)"
"How do you make a service cacheable using declarative XML-based caching in Spring Boot?","To make a service cacheable using declarative XML-based caching in Spring Boot, you need to define the service bean, cache definitions, cache advice, and apply the cache advice to the appropriate points in the program using the AspectJ pointcut expression. In the example, the bookService is made cacheable by encapsulating the caching semantics in the cache:advice definition and applying the cache advice to the BookService interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/declarative-xml.html)"
"What are the benefits of using declarative XML-based caching over annotation-based caching in Spring Boot?","Declarative XML-based caching in Spring Boot supports all of the annotation-based model and can be used inside the same application. It does not touch the target code, making it easier to apply package or group or interface-wide caching. Additionally, it allows for the creation of template-like definitions. However, it is inherently more verbose compared to annotation-based caching. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/declarative-xml.html)"
"How do you configure the JDK ConcurrentMap-based Cache in Spring Boot?","To configure the JDK ConcurrentMap-based Cache in Spring Boot, you need to declare an appropriate CacheManager and use the ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean to create a CacheManager for the two nested ConcurrentMapCache instances named default and books. The following example shows how to do this: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.support.SimpleCacheManager""> <property name=""caches""> <set> <bean class=""org.springframework.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean"" p:name=""default""/> <bean class=""org.springframework.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean"" p:name=""books""/> </set> </property> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/store-configuration.html)"
"What is the purpose of the Caffeine CacheManager in Spring Boot?","The Caffeine CacheManager in Spring Boot creates a CacheManager that creates the cache on demand. It also supports custom Caffeine and CacheLoader. The following example configures a CacheManager that creates the cache on demand: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.caffeine.CaffeineCacheManager""/> You can also provide the caches to use explicitly. In that case, only those are made available by the manager. The following example shows how to do so: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.caffeine.CaffeineCacheManager""> <property name=""cacheNames""> <set> <value>default</value> <value>books</value> </set> </property> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/store-configuration.html)"
"What is the purpose of the CompositeCacheManager in Spring Boot?","The CompositeCacheManager in Spring Boot chains multiple CacheManager instances and, through the fallbackToNoOpCache flag, adds a no-op cache for all the definitions not handled by the configured cache managers. This is useful when switching environments or doing testing, and you might have cache declarations without having an actual backing cache configured. The following example shows how to use the CompositeCacheManager: <bean id=""cacheManager"" class=""org.springframework.cache.support.CompositeCacheManager""> <property name=""cacheManagers""> <list> <ref bean=""jdkCache""/> <ref bean=""gemfireCache""/> </list> </property> <property name=""fallbackToNoOpCache"" value=""true""/> </bean> (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/store-configuration.html)"
"What is the purpose of adapters in the context of caching abstraction frameworks?","Adapters in the context of caching abstraction frameworks map the caching abstraction framework on top of the storage API, as the Caffeine classes do. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/plug.html)"
"How can developers simplify the implementation of CacheManager classes for caching products that do not support JSR-107?","Developers can use the classes in the org.springframework.cache.support package, such as AbstractCacheManager, which takes care of the boiler-plate code, leaving only the actual mapping to be completed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/plug.html)"
"What is the main challenge in using different back-end caches with Spring Boot?","The main challenge in using different back-end caches with Spring Boot is that some caching products do not support JSR-107, requiring developers to provide a CacheManager and a Cache implementation. However, this can be simplified by using adapters and classes in the org.springframework.cache.support package. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/plug.html)"
"How can I set the Time To Live (TTL) or Time To Idle (TTI) for cache entries in Spring Boot?","You can set the TTL or TTI for cache entries directly through your cache provider. The cache abstraction in Spring Boot is an abstraction, not a cache implementation, so the specific data policies and topologies supported by your chosen cache provider should be controlled directly through the backing cache or its native API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/specific-config.html)"
"Can I configure eviction policies for my cache entries in Spring Boot's cache abstraction?","No, you cannot configure eviction policies directly through Spring Boot's cache abstraction. Instead, you should control eviction policies directly through your chosen cache provider or its native API when configuring the backing cache. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/specific-config.html)"
"Is it possible to set different cache configurations for different cache types in Spring Boot?","Yes, you can set different cache configurations for different cache types in Spring Boot. Since the cache abstraction is an abstraction and not a cache implementation, you should configure the specific data policies and topologies supported by your chosen cache provider directly through the backing cache or its native API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache/specific-config.html)"
"What is the concept of Observation in Micrometer and how does it support both Metrics and Traces?","The concept of Observation in Micrometer enables both Metrics and Traces in applications. Metrics support offers a way to create timers, gauges, or counters for collecting statistics about the runtime behavior of your application. Traces provide a holistic view of an entire system, crossing application boundaries; you can zoom in on particular user requests and follow their entire completion across applications. (Source: https://docs.micrometer.io/micrometer/reference/observation.html)"
"How can you customize the metadata produced with the Spring MVC ""http.server.requests"" metrics instrumentation?","You can extend the DefaultServerRequestObservationConvention for your requirements. If you want full control, you can implement the entire convention contract for the observation you're interested in. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/observability.html)"
"How do you configure an ObservationRegistry on the WebClient builder to enable the instrumentation?","Applications must configure an ObservationRegistry on the WebClient builder to enable the instrumentation; without that, observations are 'no-ops'. Spring Boot will auto-configure WebClient.Builder beans with the observation registry already set. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/observability.html)"
"What is CDS and how can it benefit Java applications?","CDS stands for Class Data Sharing, a JVM feature that can help reduce the startup time and memory footprint of Java applications. It does this by creating an archive of classes that can be shared among multiple instances of the JVM. This can be particularly useful for applications with large classpaths or that are frequently started and stopped. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cds.html)"
"How do I create a CDS archive for my Spring application?","To create a CDS archive for a Spring application, you need to specify two additional JVM flags: -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=application.jsa and -Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh. These flags will cause the application to exit automatically after the ApplicationContext has refreshed, allowing the CDS archive to be created. The JDK/JRE must have a base image, and if you get a warning about the base CDS archive not being loaded, you can create it using the command $ java -Xshare:dump. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cds.html)"
"How do I use the CDS archive I've created for my Spring application?","To use the CDS archive you've created, add the JVM flag -XX:SharedArchiveFile=application.jsa to your startup script, assuming an application.jsa file in the working directory. You can also use -Xshare:on to check if the CDS cache is effective. To figure out how effective the cache is, enable class loading logs by adding an extra attribute: -Xlog:class+load:file=cds.log. This creates a cds.log with every attempt to load a class and its source. Classes that are loaded from the cache should have a ""shared objects file"" source. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cds.html)"
"What is the purpose of the jee elements in Spring XML configuration files?","The jee elements deal with issues related to Jakarta EE (Enterprise Edition) configuration, such as looking up a JNDI object and defining EJB references.

"What is the advantage of using Kotlin's reified type parameters in the Spring Framework?","Kotlin's reified type parameters provide a workaround for JVM generics type erasure, which is a limitation of Java's type system. This allows for a better Kotlin API in the Spring Framework, as it enables stronger type checking and better type inference. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"How does the Spring Framework support instantiating Kotlin classes through primary constructors?","The Spring Framework supports instantiating Kotlin classes through primary constructors by using the @Autowired annotation on the constructor parameters. This allows for automatic wiring of dependencies when creating instances of Kotlin classes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/classes-interfaces.html)"
"What is the purpose of the KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer in Spring Framework?","The KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer is used in the Spring Framework to find interface method parameter names without requiring the Java 8 -parameters compiler flag to be enabled during compilation. This allows for better parameter name exposure in Kotlin interfaces. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/classes-interfaces.html)"
"What are the restrictions on declaring configuration classes in Kotlin in the Spring Framework?","Configuration classes in Kotlin cannot be declared as inner classes in the Spring Framework. This is because inner classes require a reference to the outer class, which is not supported by the Spring Framework. Configuration classes can be declared as top level or nested, but not inner. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/classes-interfaces.html)"
"How does Spring Framework use Kotlin null-safety to determine if an HTTP parameter is required?","Spring Framework uses Kotlin null-safety to determine if an HTTP parameter is required by treating @RequestParam name: String? as not required and @RequestParam name: String as required. This feature is also supported on the Spring Messaging @Header annotation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/annotations.html)"
"How does the use of lateinit and nullable types affect Spring bean injection?","The use of lateinit and nullable types in Spring bean injection affects whether a bean is required or not. For example, @Autowired lateinit var thing: Thing implies that a bean of type Thing must be registered in the application context, while @Autowired lateinit var thing: Thing? does not raise an error if such a bean does not exist. Similarly, @Bean fun play(toy: Toy, car: Car?) = Baz(toy, Car) implies that a bean of type Toy must be registered, while a bean of type Car may or may not exist. The same behavior applies to autowired constructor parameters. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/annotations.html)"
"What should you consider when using bean validation on classes with properties or a primary constructor parameter in Kotlin?","When using bean validation on classes with properties or a primary constructor parameter in Kotlin, you may need to use annotation use-site targets, such as @field:NotNull or @get:Size(min=5, max=15), as described in this Stack Overflow response. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/languages/kotlin/annotations.html, https://stackoverflow.com/a/35853200/1092077)"

"How does Spring Data determine whether to register a converter as a reading or writing converter?","Spring Data inspects the Converter implementations for the source and target types they convert from and to. Depending on whether one of those is a type the underlying data access API can handle natively, the converter instance is registered as a reading or a writing converter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/custom-conversions.html)"
"What is the difference between a writing converter and a reading converter in Spring Data?","A writing converter is used to convert from a source type to a target type, while a reading converter is used to convert from a target type to a source type. The difference lies in the order of the qualifiers on Converter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/custom-conversions.html)"
"How does Spring Data determine whether an entity is new by default?","By default, Spring Data inspects the identifier property of the given entity. If the identifier property is null or 0 in case of primitive types, then the entity is assumed to be new. Otherwise, it is assumed to not be new. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/is-new-state-detection.html)"
"What happens if a property annotated with @Version is present and null or 0 in case of a version property of primitive type?","If a property annotated with @Version is present and null, or in case of a version property of primitive type 0, the entity is considered new. If the version property is present but has a different value, the entity is considered to not be new. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/is-new-state-detection.html)"
"How can you customize the EntityInformation abstraction used in the repository base implementation?","You can customize the EntityInformation abstraction used in the repository base implementation by creating a subclass of the module specific repository factory and overriding the getEntityInformation(…) method. You then have to register the custom implementation of module specific repository factory as a Spring bean. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/is-new-state-detection.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/kotlin/object-mapping.html)"
"What are Kotlin extensions and how do they enhance Spring Data APIs?","Kotlin extensions are a feature that allows you to add new functionality to existing classes. Spring Data Kotlin APIs use these extensions to provide additional Kotlin-specific conveniences to existing Spring APIs. This makes the API more Kotlin-friendly and easier to use. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"Why are Kotlin reified type parameters important in Spring Data Kotlin APIs?","Kotlin reified type parameters provide a workaround for JVM generics type erasure, which is a limitation in Java. This allows Spring Data to take advantage of this feature and create a better Kotlin API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"How do I use Kotlin extensions in my Spring Data Kotlin code?","To use Kotlin extensions in your Spring Data Kotlin code, you need to import them. Similar to static imports, an IDE should automatically suggest the import in most cases. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/kotlin/extensions.html)"
"What are Kotlin Coroutines and how do they help in writing non-blocking code?","Kotlin Coroutines are instances of suspendable computations that allow developers to write non-blocking code imperatively. They provide an abstraction for asynchronous operations and are supported by the kotlinx.coroutines library. The library offers functions like async { } and types like Flow. Spring Data modules provide support for Coroutines on the Deferred and Flow return values, and this support is enabled when kotlinx-coroutines-core, kotlinx-coroutines-reactive, and kotlinx-coroutines-reactor dependencies are in the classpath. Supported versions are 1.3.0 and above. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/kotlin/coroutines.html)"
"How does the translation from Reactive to Coroutines APIs work for return values?","The translation from Reactive to Coroutines APIs for return values is as follows: fun handler(): Mono<Void> becomes suspend fun handler(), fun handler(): Mono<T> becomes suspend fun handler(): T or suspend fun handler(): T? depending on if the Mono can be empty or not, and fun handler(): Flux<T> becomes fun handler(): Flow<T>. Flow is the equivalent of Flux in the Coroutines world and is suitable for hot or cold streams, finite or infinite streams. Flow has only a single suspending collect method, and operators are implemented as extensions. Operators are easy to implement thanks to Coroutines, and extensions allow adding custom operators to Flow. Collect operations are suspending functions, and the map operator supports asynchronous operation since it takes a suspending function parameter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/reference/3.3/kotlin/coroutines.html)"
"What is the difference between Flow and Flux in terms of how backpressure is implemented?","Backpressure is implemented via suspending functions in Flow, while Flux uses a push-pull hybrid approach. Flow has only a single suspending collect method, and operators are implemented as extensions. Operators are easy to implement thanks to Coroutines.

"What is the purpose of Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC?","The purpose of Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC is to provide repository support for the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) APIs, respectively. They aim to ease the development of applications with a consistent programming model that need to access SQL data sources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/index.html)"
"What is the difference between Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC?","Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC are two different approaches for accessing SQL data sources with Spring Data. JDBC is a traditional approach, while R2DBC is a reactive approach. They both provide repository support, but R2DBC is designed for reactive programming and can provide better performance and scalability in certain scenarios. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/index.html)"
"Does Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC support Kotlin?","Yes, Spring Data JDBC and R2DBC support Kotlin. There is a specific section in the documentation that provides information on Kotlin-specific support. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/index.html)"

"What is the primary objective of the Spring Data repository abstraction?","The goal of the Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/introduction.html)"
"What are the core concepts explained in the 'Introduction' chapter of Spring Data repositories?","The core concepts explained in the 'Introduction' chapter of Spring Data repositories include Defining Repository Interfaces, Creating Repository Instances, Defining Query Methods, Projections, Object Mapping Fundamentals, Custom Conversions, Custom Repository Implementations, Spring Data Extensions, Value Expressions Fundamentals, Query by Example, Publishing Events from Aggregate Roots, Entity Callbacks, Null Handling of Repository Methods, Repository query keywords, and Repository query return types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/introduction.html)"
"What is the purpose of the 'core-concepts.html' section in the Spring Data repositories documentation?","The 'core-concepts.html' section in the Spring Data repositories documentation provides an overview of the fundamental concepts related to Spring Data repositories. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/introduction.html)"
"What is the central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction and what does it do?","The central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction is Repository. It acts as a marker interface to capture the types to work with and to help discover interfaces that extend this one. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the methods provided by the CrudRepository interface and what do they do?","The CrudRepository interface provides the following methods: save(S entity), findById(ID primaryKey), findAll(), count(), delete(T entity), and existsById(ID primaryKey). These methods are commonly referred to as CRUD methods and offer sophisticated CRUD functionality for the entity class being managed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the additional methods provided by the PagingAndSortingRepository interface and how can they be used?","The PagingAndSortingRepository interface provides additional methods for paginated access to entities: findAll(Sort sort) and Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable). To access the second page of User by a page size of 20, you could do something like the following: Page<User> users = repository.findAll(PageRequest.of(1, 20)); (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"How do you define a repository interface in Spring Data?","To define a repository interface, you first need to define a domain class-specific repository interface. The interface must extend Repository and be typed to the domain class and an ID type. If you want to expose CRUD methods for that domain type, you may extend CrudRepository , or one of its variants instead of Repository . (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"What is the difference between CrudRepository and ListCrudRepository in Spring Data?","CrudRepository gives you methods for CRUD functionality. With version 3.0 we also introduced ListCrudRepository which is very similar to the CrudRepository but for those methods that return multiple entities it returns a List instead of an Iterable which you might find easier to use. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How can you fine-tune the definition of a repository interface in Spring Data?","There are a few variants how you can get started with your repository interface. The typical approach is to extend CrudRepository , which gives you methods for CRUD functionality. If you are using a reactive store you might choose ReactiveCrudRepository , or RxJava3CrudRepository depending on which reactive framework you are using. If you are using Kotlin you might pick CoroutineCrudRepository which utilizes Kotlin’s coroutines. Additional you can extend PagingAndSortingRepository , ReactiveSortingRepository , RxJava3SortingRepository , or CoroutineSortingRepository if you need methods that allow to specify a Sort abstraction or in the first case a Pageable abstraction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How does Spring Data determine the actual query to be created for a repository method?","Spring Data uses a query lookup strategy to determine the actual query to be created for a repository method. The strategy can be configured through XML or Java configuration. The default strategy is CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND, which first looks up a declared query and, if not found, creates a custom method name-based query. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-methods-details.html#query-lookup-strategies)"
"What are the different query creation strategies available in Spring Data?","The available query creation strategies in Spring Data are CREATE, USE_DECLARED_QUERY, and CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND. The CREATE strategy attempts to construct a store-specific query from the method name. The USE_DECLARED_QUERY strategy tries to find a manually defined query and throws an exception if it cannot find one. The CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND strategy combines CREATE and USE_DECLARED_QUERY, first looking up a declared query and, if not found, creating a custom method name-based query. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-methods-details.html#query-creation)"
"How can I handle large query results in Spring Data?","To handle large query results in Spring Data, you can use different methods such as List, Streamable, Stream, Flux, Slice, and Page. Each method has its own advantages and constraints. For example, using a List returns all results at once, which can be memory-intensive, while using a Stream returns results one by one, which can be more efficient for large datasets. You can also use pagination, sorting, and limiting to manage large query results. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/query-methods-details.html#paging-iterating-large-results-sorting-limiting)"
"What are projections in Spring Data and why are they useful?","Projections in Spring Data are used to create partial views of managed aggregates, allowing developers to retrieve only specific attributes of those types. This is useful when you want to limit the amount of data returned by a query, improving performance and reducing unnecessary data transfer. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"How can you limit the result of a query to only the name attributes in Spring Data?","To limit the result of a query to only the name attributes, you can declare an interface that exposes accessor methods for the properties to be read. This is known as an interface-based projection. The query execution engine creates proxy instances of that interface at runtime for each element returned and forwards calls to the exposed methods to the target object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"What is the difference between closed and open projections in Spring Data?","A closed projection is a projection interface whose accessor methods all match properties of the target aggregate. Spring Data can optimize the query execution when using a closed projection because it knows about all the attributes needed to back the projection proxy. An open projection is a projection interface where accessor methods can also be used to compute new values by using the @Value annotation. Spring Data cannot apply query execution optimizations in this case because the SpEL expression could use any attribute of the aggregate root. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"How does Spring Data determine the constructor to use for object creation?","Spring Data automatically tries to detect a persistent entity’s constructor to be used to materialize objects of that type. The resolution algorithm works as follows: If there is a single static factory method annotated with @PersistenceCreator then it is used. If there is a single constructor, it is used. If there are multiple constructors and exactly one is annotated with @PersistenceCreator , it is used. If the type is a Java Record the canonical constructor is used. If there’s a no-argument constructor, it is used. Other constructors will be ignored. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/object-mapping.html)"
"What is the difference between property population and object creation in Spring Data object mapping?","Object creation involves creating instances of domain objects and mapping the store-native data structures onto those. Property population, on the other hand, involves setting the remaining persistent properties of an entity instance after it has been created. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/object-mapping.html)"
"How does Spring Data handle overridden properties in Kotlin?","Spring Data adapts specifics of Kotlin to allow object creation and mutation. However, delegated properties are not supported with Spring Data. The mapping metadata filters delegated properties for Kotlin Data classes. In all other cases, you can exclude synthetic fields for delegated properties by annotating the property with @delegate:org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/object-mapping.html)"
"What does the @ReadingConverter annotation do in Spring Converter implementations?","The @ReadingConverter annotation is used in Spring Converter implementations to register a converter as a reading converter. It is used when the source type is a native type that can be handled natively by the underlying data access API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/custom-conversions.html)"
"What is the purpose of the CustomConversions class in Spring Data?","The CustomConversions class in Spring Data is the central facility that allows registration and querying for registered converters based on source and target type. It ships with a pre-defined set of converter registrations, including JSR-310 Converters for conversion between java.time, java.util.Date, and String types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/custom-conversions.html)"
"How can you force the infrastructure to register a converter for only one way in Spring Data?","You can force the infrastructure to register a converter for only one way in Spring Data by using the @ReadingConverter and @WritingConverter annotations in the converter implementation. These annotations allow you to specify whether the converter should be registered as a reading or writing converter. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/custom-conversions.html)"
"How can you customize a Spring Data repository with additional functionality?","To customize a Spring Data repository, you need to define a fragment interface and an implementation for the custom functionality. The interface should declare the custom methods, and the implementation should provide the actual implementation. The class name of the implementation should follow the naming convention of appending the postfix 'Impl'. Then, you can let your repository interface extend the fragment interface. This combination of the CRUD and custom functionality is then available to clients. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/custom-implementations.html>)"
"How can you reuse customizations across different repositories in Spring Data?","You can reuse customizations across different repositories in Spring Data by creating a repository fragment interface and its implementation. Multiple repositories can use the fragment interface, allowing you to reuse the customizations. The fragment interface and its implementation can be imported into the repository interfaces, and they are combined with the CRUD and other custom functionality. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/custom-implementations.html>)"
"How can you customize the base repository behavior in Spring Data?","To customize the base repository behavior in Spring Data, you can create an implementation that extends the persistence technology-specific repository base class. This class then acts as a custom base class for the repository proxies. The final step is to make the Spring Data infrastructure aware of the customized repository base class by using the repositoryBaseClass in configuration. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/custom-implementations.html>)"
"What is Querydsl and what is its purpose in Spring Data?","Querydsl is a framework that enables the construction of statically typed SQL-like queries through its fluent API. In Spring Data, Querydsl integration is provided through the QuerydslPredicateExecutor interface, which allows for the execution of type-safe queries using Querydsl Predicate instances. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-extensions.html>)"
"How can you enable Spring Data web support in a JavaConfig configuration class?","You can enable Spring Data web support in a JavaConfig configuration class by using the @EnableSpringDataWebSupport annotation. This annotation registers several components, including support for domain class conversion, Pageable and Sort resolution, and Jackson modules for de-/serializing types like Point and Distance. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-extensions.html>)"
"How can you use a PagedResourcesAssembler as a controller method argument to create a hypermedia-enabled representation of a Page instance?","To use a PagedResourcesAssembler as a controller method argument, you need to add the PagedResourcesAssembler as a method argument and call the toModel() method on it. This will create a PagedModel instance with the content of the Page, pagination metadata, and hypermedia links. The toModel() method also automatically resolves the parameters into a Pageable for an upcoming request. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-extensions.html>)"
"What is the purpose of Value Expressions in Spring Boot?","Value Expressions are a combination of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and Property Placeholder Resolution. They allow developers to evaluate powerful expressions and obtain values from the Environment such as configuration properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/value-expressions.html)"
"How can Value Expressions be defined in Spring Boot?","Value Expressions can be defined from a sole SpEL Expression, a Property Placeholder, or a composite expression mixing various expressions including literals. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/value-expressions.html)"
"What is the importance of parsing and evaluation in Value Expressions?","Parsing and Evaluation of Value Expressions are handled by the ValueExpressionParser API. Instances of ValueExpression are thread-safe and can be cached for later use to avoid repeated parsing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/value-expressions.html)"
"What is Query by Example (QBE) and how does it differ from traditional querying techniques?","Query by Example (QBE) is a user-friendly querying technique that allows dynamic query creation without requiring the use of store-specific query languages. It simplifies the process of querying data stores by eliminating the need to write queries with field names. Instead, users can create queries using a domain object with populated fields. This approach is well suited for querying data stores with static or dynamic constraints and is independent of the underlying data store API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the key components of the Query by Example API and how do they work together?","The Query by Example API consists of four main components: Probe, ExampleMatcher, Example, and FetchableFluentQuery. The Probe is the domain object with populated fields that serves as the basis for the query. The ExampleMatcher carries details on how to match particular fields and can be reused across multiple Examples. An Example consists of the probe and the ExampleMatcher and is used to create the query. The FetchableFluentQuery offers a fluent API for further customization of a query derived from an Example, allowing the specification of ordering, projection, and result processing. These components work together to provide a flexible and user-friendly querying experience. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the limitations of Query by Example, and how can users address these limitations?","Query by Example has several limitations, including no support for nested or grouped property constraints, store-specific support for string matching, and exact matching for other property types. Users can address these limitations by using the ExampleMatcher to specify their own defaults for string matching, null handling, and property-specific settings. Additionally, users can tune the matcher options and case sensitivity for individual properties. By default, the ExampleMatcher expects all values set on the probe to match, but users can use ExampleMatcher.matchingAny() to get results matching any of the predicates defined. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/query-by-example.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @DomainEvents annotation in Spring Data?","The @DomainEvents annotation in Spring Data is used to make the publication of domain events as easy as possible for aggregate roots. It can be used on a method of your aggregate root to return either a single event instance or a collection of events. It must not take any arguments. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @AfterDomainEventPublication annotation in Spring Data?","The @AfterDomainEventPublication annotation in Spring Data is used to potentially clean the list of events to be published (among other uses). It is called after all events have been published. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"When are the methods annotated with @DomainEvents and @AfterDomainEventPublication called?","The methods annotated with @DomainEvents and @AfterDomainEventPublication are called every time one of the following Spring Data repository methods are called: save(...), saveAll(...), delete(...), deleteAll(...), deleteAllInBatch(...), deleteInBatch(...). Note that deleteById(...) is notably absent as the implementations might choose to issue a query deleting the instance and thus we would never have access to the aggregate instance in the first place.

"What are Entity Callbacks in Spring Data?","Entity Callbacks are hooks provided by the Spring Data infrastructure that allow for modifying an entity before and after certain methods are invoked. They provide a convenient way to check and potentially modify an entity in a callback-fashioned style. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/entity-callbacks.html)"
"What is the recommended way of applying entity modifications in Spring Data?","The recommended way of applying entity modifications in Spring Data is through Entity Callbacks. This approach provides integration points with both synchronous and reactive APIs to guarantee in-order execution at well-defined checkpoints within the processing chain, returning a potentially modified entity or a reactive wrapper type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/commons/entity-callbacks.html)"
"How are Entity Callbacks registered in Spring Data?","EntityCallback beans are picked up by the store-specific implementations in case they are registered in the ApplicationContext. Most template APIs already implement ApplicationContextAware and therefore have access to the ApplicationContext. Entity Callbacks can be registered using various methods, such as component annotation, @Order annotation, or implementing the Ordered interface.

"What is the importance of 'repository', 'aggregate', and 'aggregate root' concepts in Spring Data JDBC?","The concepts of 'repository', 'aggregate', and 'aggregate root' are inspired by Domain Driven Design and are crucial for Spring Data JDBC. They are contrary to normal practice when working with relational databases. A repository is an abstraction over a persistent store that looks like a collection of all the aggregates of a certain type. An aggregate is a group of entities that is guaranteed to be consistent between atomic changes to it. Aggregates have exactly one aggregate root, which is one of the entities of the aggregate. The aggregate gets manipulated only through methods on that aggregate root. These are the atomic changes mentioned earlier. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/domain-driven-design.html)"
"What is the relationship between entities and aggregates in Spring Data JDBC?","In Spring Data JDBC, entities reachable from an aggregate root are considered to be part of that aggregate root. Spring Data JDBC assumes that only the aggregate has a foreign key to a table storing non-root entities of the aggregate and no other entity points toward non-root entities. Entities referenced from an aggregate root are deleted and recreated by Spring Data JDBC. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/domain-driven-design.html)"
"How can you customize the behavior of repositories in Spring Data JDBC?","You can overwrite the repository methods with implementations that match your style of working and designing your database.

"What are the requirements for using Spring Data JDBC?","Spring Data JDBC requires Spring Framework (https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/6.1) 6.1.13 and above. In terms of databases, Spring Data JDBC requires a dialect (#jdbc.dialects) to abstract common SQL functionality over vendor-specific flavours. Spring Data JDBC includes direct support for the following databases: DB2, H2, HSQLDB, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and Postgres. If you use a different database, your application won't start up. The dialect (#jdbc.dialects) section contains further detail on how to proceed in such case."
"How can I create a Spring project in STS and set up the necessary dependencies for Spring Data JDBC?","To create a Spring project in STS, go to File → New → Spring Template Project → Simple Spring Utility Project, and press Yes when prompted. Then enter a project and a package name, such as org.spring.jdbc.example. Add the following to the pom.xml files dependencies element: <dependencies> <!-- other dependency elements omitted --> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId> <artifactId>spring-data-jdbc</artifactId> <version>3.3.4</version> </dependency> </dependencies> Change the version of Spring in the pom.xml to be <spring.version>6.1.13</spring.version> Add the following location of the Spring Milestone repository for Maven to your pom.xml such that it is at the same level as your <dependencies/> element: <repositories> <repository> <id>spring-milestone</id> <name>Spring Maven MILESTONE Repository</name> <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url> </repository> </repositories> The repository is also browseable here (https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/data/)."
"How can you perform aggregate persistence using Spring Data JDBC?","You can perform aggregate persistence using the CrudRepository.save(...) method in Spring Data JDBC. If the aggregate is new, it will result in an insert for the aggregate root and subsequent insert statements for all directly or indirectly referenced entities. If the aggregate root is not new, all referenced entities will be deleted, the aggregate root will be updated, and all referenced entities will be inserted again. Note that whether an instance is new is part of the instance’s state. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/entity-persistence.html)"
"What are the limitations of Spring Data JDBC when updating an aggregate?","Spring Data JDBC has some limitations when updating an aggregate. It does not know the previous state of an aggregate, so any update process always has to take whatever it finds in the database and make sure it converts it to whatever is the state of the entity passed to the save method. This can be wasteful if only a few of the referenced entities have been actually changed. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/3.3/jdbc/entity-persistence.html)"
"What is Single Query Loading in Spring Data JDBC and what are its limitations?","Single Query Loading in Spring Data JDBC is a feature that allows the loading of arbitrarily complex aggregates with a single SQL query, which can be more efficient than loading aggregates with separate statements. However, there are certain limitations to Single Query Loading. It is restricted to aggregates without nested collections, it does not support AggregateReference or embedded entities, and it is only supported by some database dialects. It also only works for the find methods in CrudRepository, not for derived queries and not for annotated queries.

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/getting-started.html)"
"What is the simplest way to get started with a Hello World example using Spring Data JPA?","Create an @Entity class (e.g., Person), a corresponding repository interface (e.g., PersonRepository), and a main application that uses Spring Boot to run the application. The basic repository extends Repository, and you can consider using ListCrudRepository or JpaRepository for more complex use cases. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/getting-started.html)"
"What is the central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction?","The central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction is Repository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the two interfaces that provide CRUD functionality in Spring Data?","The two interfaces that provide CRUD functionality in Spring Data are CrudRepository and ListCrudRepository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"What are the methods declared in the CrudRepository interface?","The methods declared in the CrudRepository interface are save, findById, findAll, count, delete, and existsById. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html)"
"How can you define a repository interface in Spring Data JPA?","To define a repository interface, you first need to define a domain class-specific repository interface. The interface must extend Repository and be typed to the domain class and an ID type. If you want to expose CRUD methods for that domain type, you may extend CrudRepository, or one of its variants instead of Repository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"What are the different variants of repository interfaces in Spring Data JPA?","There are a few variants how you can get started with your repository interface. The typical approach is to extend CrudRepository, which gives you methods for CRUD functionality. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. With version 3.0 we also introduced ListCrudRepository which is very similar to the CrudRepository but for those methods that return multiple entities it returns a List instead of an Iterable which you might find easier to use. If you are using a reactive store you might choose ReactiveCrudRepository, or RxJava3CrudRepository depending on which reactive framework you are using. If you are using Kotlin you might pick CoroutineCrudRepository which utilizes Kotlin’s coroutines. Additional you can extend PagingAndSortingRepository, ReactiveSortingRepository, RxJava3SortingRepository, or CoroutineSortingRepository if you need methods that allow to specify a Sort abstraction or in the first case a Pageable abstraction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How can you selectively expose CRUD methods in your repository interface?","If you prefer to be selective about the methods being exposed, copy the methods you want to expose from the CRUD repository into your domain repository. When doing so, you may change the return type of methods. Spring Data will honor the return type if possible. For example, for methods returning multiple entities you may choose Iterable<T>, List<T>, Collection<T> or a VAVR list. If many repositories in your application should have the same set of methods you can define your own base interface to inherit from. Such an interface must be annotated with @NoRepositoryBean. This prevents Spring Data to try to create an instance of it directly and failing because it can’t determine the entity for that repository, since it still contains a generic type variable. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html)"
"How can Spring Data JPA repositories be configured through Java configuration?","Spring Data JPA repositories can be configured through Java configuration by using the @Configuration annotation, the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation, and the @EnableTransactionManagement annotation. Additionally, a LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean should be created and not EntityManagerFactory directly. The preceding configuration class sets up an embedded HSQL database by using the EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder API of spring-jdbc. Spring Data then sets up an EntityManagerFactory and uses Hibernate as the sample persistence provider. The last infrastructure component declared here is the JpaTransactionManager. Finally, the example activates Spring Data JPA repositories by using the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation, which essentially carries the same attributes as the XML namespace. If no base package is configured, it uses the one in which the configuration class resides. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/create-instances.html>)"
"What is the advantage of using JavaConfig over XML for configuring Spring Data JPA repositories?","Using JavaConfig for configuring Spring Data JPA repositories offers several advantages over XML. It allows for a more concise and readable configuration, as well as better integration with other Java-based frameworks and libraries. Additionally, it enables the use of annotations and other modern Java features, such as record types. New projects typically use as much pure Java as possible, and while there is no immediate plan to remove XML support, some of the newest features MAY not be available through XML. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/create-instances.html>)"
"What is the difference between LAZY and DEFERRED bootstrap modes in Spring Data JPA repositories?","The LAZY and DEFERRED bootstrap modes in Spring Data JPA repositories differ in their initialization and verification timing. LAZY mode declares all repository beans as lazy and creates lazy initialization proxies to be injected into client beans. Repository instances will be initialized and verified upon first interaction with the repository. DEFERRED mode is similar to LAZY mode, but triggers repository initialization in response to a ContextRefreshedEvent, ensuring that repositories are verified before the application has completely started. The default bootstrap mode is DEFAULT, which instantiates repositories eagerly unless explicitly annotated with @Lazy. DEFERRED is a reasonable default for asynchronous JPA bootstrap scenarios, as it ensures proper initialization and validation before the application signals it's up. LAZY is suitable for testing and local development scenarios where unnecessary verification can be avoided. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/create-instances.html>)"
"How can you persist or save entities using Spring Data JPA?","You can persist or save entities using the CrudRepository.save(…) method in Spring Data JPA. This method either persists or merges the given entity by using the underlying JPA EntityManager. If the entity has not yet been persisted, Spring Data JPA saves the entity with a call to the entityManager.persist(…) method. Otherwise, it calls the entityManager.merge(…) method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/entity-persistence.html)"
"How does Spring Data JPA determine whether an entity is new or not?","Spring Data JPA offers several strategies to detect whether an entity is new or not. By default, it first checks if there is a Version-property of non-primitive type. If there is, the entity is considered new if the value of that property is null. Without such a Version-property, Spring Data JPA inspects the identifier property of the given entity. If the identifier property is null, then the entity is assumed to be new. Otherwise, it is assumed to be not new. You can also implement the Persistable interface or customize the EntityInformation abstraction for more control over new detection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/entity-persistence.html)"
"What is an example of a common pattern for entities with manually assigned identifiers and no version attribute?","A common pattern for entities with manually assigned identifiers and no version attribute is to use a common base class with a transient flag defaulting to indicate a new instance and using JPA lifecycle callbacks to flip that flag on persistence operations. This can be achieved by creating an abstract class that implements Persistable and using @PrePersist and @PostLoad annotations to switch the flag to indicate an existing entity after a repository call to save(…) or an instance creation by the persistence provider. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/entity-persistence.html)"
"What are the three available options for query lookup strategies in Spring Data repository infrastructure?","The three available options for query lookup strategies in Spring Data repository infrastructure are CREATE, USE_DECLARED_QUERY, and CREATE_IF_NOT_FOUND. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-lookup-strategies)"
"How can you define constraints on entity properties in Spring Data repository query methods?","To define constraints on entity properties in Spring Data repository query methods, you can use the property expressions in the query method names. Property expressions can refer to a direct property of the managed entity or nested properties. You can also use operators like Between, LessThan, GreaterThan, and Like for property expressions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-creation)"
"What are the possible query method return types in Spring Data repository?","The possible query method return types in Spring Data repository include List, Set, and Iterable, as well as Streamable, custom wrapper types, and Vavr collections.

"What is the purpose of the @Meta annotation in Spring Data JPA?","The @Meta annotation is used to add comments to queries in Spring Data JPA. This can be helpful for debugging and performance optimization. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/query-methods.html#jpa.query-methods.meta-annotations)"
"How can I apply query hints in Spring Data JPA?","To apply JPA query hints in Spring Data JPA, you can use the @QueryHints annotation. This annotation takes an array of JPA @QueryHint annotations and a boolean flag to potentially disable the hints applied to the additional count query triggered when applying pagination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/query-methods.html#jpa.query-methods.query-hints)"
"What is the difference between a derived delete query and a manual delete query in Spring Data JPA?","A derived delete query is a shortcut for running the query and then calling CrudRepository.delete(Iterable<User> users) on the result and keeping behavior in sync with the implementations of other delete(…) methods in CrudRepository. On the other hand, a manual delete query runs a query and then deletes the returned instances one by one, so that the persistence provider can actually invoke @PreRemove callbacks on those entities. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/query-methods.html#jpa.query-methods.deleting)"
"What is the purpose of projections in Spring Data?","Projections in Spring Data are used to create views of the managed aggregates, returning partial views of the entities based on certain attributes. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html>)"
"What is the difference between class-based and interface-based projections in Spring Data?","Class-based projections are types residing outside the entity's type hierarchy, while interface-based projections are interfaces that expose accessor methods for the properties to be read. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html>)"
"How can you include nested projections in Spring Data?","To include nested projections, create a projection interface for the nested object and return that interface from the declaration of the nested property. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @Procedure annotation in JPA 2.1?","The @Procedure annotation is used to declare stored procedure metadata on a repository method. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/stored-procedures.html)"
"How can you configure metadata for stored procedures in JPA?","Metadata for stored procedures can be configured by using the NamedStoredProcedureQuery annotation on an entity type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/stored-procedures.html)"
"What is the difference between the name and procedureName attributes in the @NamedStoredProcedureQuery annotation?","The name attribute is the name JPA uses, while the procedureName attribute is the name the stored procedure has in the database. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/stored-procedures.html)"
"What is the purpose of the JPA 2 criteria API?","The JPA 2 criteria API allows you to build queries programmatically. By writing a criteria, you define the where clause of a query for a domain class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/specifications.html)"
"What is the role of the Specification interface in Spring Data JPA?","The Specification interface is used to define predicates over an entity that can be combined and used with JpaRepository without the need to declare a query for every needed combination. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/specifications.html)"
"How can you use a Specification to delete entries in JPA 2.1?","You can use the `delete(Specification)` API provided by JpaSpecificationExecutor to delete entries based on a Specification. The Specification builds up a criteria, which is then used to generate the right DELETE operation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/specifications.html)"
"What is Query by Example (QBE) and how does it work?","Query by Example (QBE) is a user-friendly querying technique with a simple interface that allows dynamic query creation and does not require you to write queries that contain field names. It does not require you to write queries by using store-specific query languages at all. QBE uses a probe, which is an actual example of a domain object with populated fields, and an ExampleMatcher, which carries details on how to match particular fields. An Example consists of the probe and the ExampleMatcher and is used to create the query. A FetchableFluentQuery offers a fluent API that allows further customization of a query derived from an Example. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the limitations of Query by Example?","Query by Example has several limitations, including no support for nested or grouped property constraints, such as firstname = ?0 or (firstname = ?1 and lastname = ?2). Store-specific support on string matching may be limited, depending on the database. Exact matching is supported for other property types. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"How can you customize the matching behavior in Query by Example?","You can specify your own defaults for string matching, null handling, and property-specific settings by using the ExampleMatcher. You can also tune it with matching options and case sensitivity for individual properties. Settings on a property path have higher precedence than default settings. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"What is the default transaction configuration for methods inherited from CrudRepository?","The default transaction configuration for methods inherited from CrudRepository is determined by SimpleJpaRepository. For read operations, the transaction configuration readOnly flag is set to true. All other methods are configured with a plain @Transactional so that default transaction configuration applies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/transactions.html)"
"How can you customize transaction configuration for a specific method in a repository?","To customize transaction configuration for a specific method in a repository, you can redeclare the method in your repository interface with the desired transaction attributes, such as timeout and readOnly flag. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/transactions.html)"
"How can you define transaction boundaries for non-CRUD operations using a facade or service implementation?","You can define transaction boundaries for non-CRUD operations by using a facade or service implementation that covers more than one repository. This can be done by declaring the facade or service implementation with the @Transactional annotation, which causes the method calls within the facade to run inside a transaction. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/transactions.html)"
"How can you specify the lock mode to be used in Spring Data JPA?","You can use the @Lock annotation on query methods or redeclare CRUD methods in your repository interface and add the @Lock annotation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/jpa/locking.html)"

"How can I benefit from auditing functionality provided by Spring Data?","To benefit from auditing functionality provided by Spring Data, you need to equip your entity classes with auditing metadata that can be defined either using annotations or by implementing an interface. Additionally, auditing has to be enabled either through Annotation configuration or XML configuration to register the required infrastructure components. Please refer to the store-specific section for configuration samples. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/auditing.html)"
"What is the difference between annotation-based and interface-based auditing metadata in Spring Data?","Annotation-based auditing metadata uses @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, @CreatedDate, and @LastModifiedDate to capture the user who created or modified the entity and when the change happened. Interface-based auditing metadata involves letting your domain class implement the Auditable interface, which exposes setter methods for all of the auditing properties. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/auditing.html)"
"How can I make my application aware of the current principal for @CreatedBy or @LastModifiedBy in Spring Data?","To make your application aware of the current principal for @CreatedBy or @LastModifiedBy, you need to implement the AuditorAware<T> SPI interface, which tells the infrastructure who the current user or system interacting with the application is. The generic type T defines what type the properties annotated with @CreatedBy or @LastModifiedBy have to be. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/3.3/auditing.html)"
"How can you merge multiple persistence units into a single one in Spring Data JPA?","You can use the MergingPersistenceUnitManager implementation, which automatically merges persistence units based on their name.

This makes it possible to replace the Redis implementation with an in-memory one for testing purposes, which greatly increases testability. Additionally, moving from development to production environments becomes transparent, as the code is not tied to a specific storage implementation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/support-classes.html)"
"What is the primary goal of the Spring Data repository abstraction?","The goal of the Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories.html#core-concepts)"
"What version of Redis Server is required for working with Redis Repositories?","Redis Repositories require at least Redis Server version 2.8.0 and do not work with transactions. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories.html#redis-repositories)"
"How can you ensure that a RedisTemplate is used with disabled transaction support?","Make sure to use a RedisTemplate with disabled transaction support. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories.html#tx.spring)"
"What is the central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction?","Repository (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html>) "
"What are the two main interfaces that provide CRUD functionality in Spring Data?","CrudRepository and ListCrudRepository (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html>) "
"What interface provides paginated access to entities in Spring Data?","PagingAndSortingRepository (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/core-concepts.html>) "
"How do you define a repository interface in Spring Data?","To define a repository interface, you first need to define a domain class-specific repository interface. The interface must extend Repository and be typed to the domain class and an ID type. If you want to expose CRUD methods for that domain type, you may extend CrudRepository, or one of its variants instead of Repository. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html>)"
"What are the different variants of repository interfaces in Spring Data?","There are several variants of repository interfaces in Spring Data, including CrudRepository, ListCrudRepository, ReactiveCrudRepository, RxJava3CrudRepository, and CoroutineCrudRepository. Additionally, you can extend PagingAndSortingRepository, ReactiveSortingRepository, RxJava3SortingRepository, or CoroutineSortingRepository if you need methods that allow to specify a Sort abstraction or a Pageable abstraction. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html>)"
"How can you selectively expose CRUD methods in a repository interface?","To selectively expose CRUD methods in a repository interface, you can copy the methods you want to expose from the CRUD repository into your domain repository. When doing so, you may change the return type of methods. Spring Data will honor the return type if possible. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/definition.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the @RedisHash annotation in Spring Data Redis?","The @RedisHash annotation in Spring Data Redis is used to create the actual key used to persist the hash. It is responsible for creating a keyspace in Redis and is placed on the type of a domain object. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/usage.html)"
"How does Spring Data Redis handle references between entities?","Spring Data Redis allows you to store a simple key reference instead of copying values into the hash itself by marking properties with @Reference. On loading from Redis, references are resolved automatically and mapped back into the object. Referenced objects are not persisted when the referencing object is saved, and you must persist changes on referenced objects separately. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/usage.html)"
"What is the purpose of the PartialUpdate class in Spring Data Redis?","The PartialUpdate class in Spring Data Redis allows you to define set and delete actions on existing objects while taking care of updating potential expiration times of both the entity itself and index structures. It is used to perform partial updates on entities, which can be useful when you need to set a new value within an entity without having to load and rewrite the entire entity. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/usage.html)"
"What is the primary responsibility of Spring Data object mapping?","The primary responsibility of Spring Data object mapping is to create instances of domain objects and map the store-native data structures onto those. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/object-mapping.html)"
"How does Spring Data determine the constructor to be used for object creation?","Spring Data automatically tries to detect a persistent entity’s constructor to be used to materialize objects of that type. The resolution algorithm works as follows: If there is a single static factory method annotated with @PersistenceCreator then it is used. If there is a single constructor, it is used. If there are multiple constructors and exactly one is annotated with @PersistenceCreator , it is used. If the type is a Java Record the canonical constructor is used. If there’s a no-argument constructor, it is used. Other constructors will be ignored. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/object-mapping.html)"
"What is the difference between mutable and immutable properties in Spring Data object mapping?","Mutable properties can be changed after their creation, while immutable properties cannot be changed once they are created. In Spring Data object mapping, mutable properties are set directly, while immutable properties are set using constructors or specific methods like with... methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/object-mapping.html)"
"How does the Redis Repository support persist objects to Hashes?","The Redis Repository support persists objects to Hashes using an Object-to-Hash conversion which is done by a RedisConverter. The default implementation uses Converter for mapping property values to and from Redis native byte[]. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/mapping.html)"
"What is the default mapping for the Person type in Redis?","The default mapping for the Person type in Redis looks like the following: _class = org.example.Person, id = e2c7dcee-b8cd-4424-883e-736ce564363e, firstname = rand, lastname = al’thor, address.city = emond's field, address.country = andor. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/mapping.html)"
"How can you customize the mapping behavior in Redis?","You can customize the mapping behavior in Redis by registering the corresponding Converter in RedisCustomConversions. Those converters can take care of converting from and to a single byte[] as well as Map<String, byte[]>. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/mapping.html)"
"What is the purpose of query methods in Redis repositories?","Query methods in Redis repositories allow automatic derivation of simple finder queries from the method name. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/queries.html)"
"How can you use a RedisCallback to provide more control over querying?","You can use a RedisCallback to provide more control over the actual matching of index structures or even custom indexes. This is done by providing a RedisCallback that returns a single or Iterable set of id values. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/queries.html)"
"How can you sort the results of Redis repository query methods?","Redis repositories allow various approaches to define sorting order. Redis itself does not support in-flight sorting when retrieving hashes or sets. Therefore, Redis repository query methods construct a Comparator that is applied to the result before returning results as List. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/queries.html)"
"What is Query by Example (QBE) and how does it simplify querying in Spring Data?","Query by Example (QBE) is a user-friendly querying technique with a simple interface that allows dynamic query creation and does not require you to write queries that contain field names. It simplifies querying in Spring Data by providing a user-friendly way to query data without needing to write queries using store-specific query languages. The core concepts of Query by Example are explained in the Spring Data Commons module, and it is well suited for querying data stores with static or dynamic constraints, frequent refactoring of domain objects, and working independently of the underlying data store API. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"What are the four main components of the Query by Example API in Spring Data?","The Query by Example API consists of four parts: Probe, ExampleMatcher, Example, and FetchableFluentQuery. The Probe is the actual example of a domain object with populated fields. ExampleMatcher carries details on how to match particular fields and can be reused across multiple Examples. An Example consists of the probe and the ExampleMatcher, and it is used to create the query. FetchableFluentQuery offers a fluent API that allows further customization of the query derived from an Example, enabling specification of ordering, projection, and result processing. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"What are some limitations of Query by Example in Spring Data?","Query by Example has several limitations, including no support for nested or grouped property constraints, store-specific support on string matching (depending on the database), and exact matching for other property types. Additionally, it does not support case-insensitive matching, regex, prefix/contains/suffix string-matching, querying of associations, collections, and map-like properties, and inclusion of null values from the criteria. findAll with sorting is also not supported. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/query-by-example.html)"
"How can you use Redis repository support in a clustered Redis environment?","You can use the Redis repository support in a clustered Redis environment by following the ConnectionFactory configuration details provided in the 'Redis Cluster(../cluster.html)' section. However, additional configuration must be done because the default key distribution spreads entities and secondary indexes through the whole cluster and its slots. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/cluster.html)"
"Why is it useful to pin keyspaces to a single slot in a Redis cluster?","Pinning keyspaces to a single slot in a Redis cluster is useful because it allows you to make use of Redis server-side computation right away, as some commands (such as SINTER and SUNION) can only be processed on the server side when all involved keys map to the same slot. Otherwise, computation has to be done on the client side. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/cluster.html)"
"How can you define and pin keyspaces in a Redis cluster using Spring Data Redis?","To define and pin keyspaces in a Redis cluster using Spring Data Redis, you can use the @RedisHash('{yourkeyspace}') annotation to specify the keyspace and pin it to a specific slot. This ensures that all keys in the specified keyspace are stored in the same slot, allowing for efficient server-side computation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/cluster.html)"
"What is the purpose of the repository abstraction in Redis repositories?","The repository abstraction in Redis repositories provides a more detailed view of commands issued by the repository for a better understanding of potential performance implications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/anatomy.html)"
"What is the difference between secondary indexes and query operations in Redis repositories?","Secondary indexes are higher level functions that Redis offers, while query operations are left up to the user. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/anatomy.html)"
"What is the process for replacing an existing entity in Redis repositories?","The process for replacing an existing entity in Redis repositories involves removing the existing hash, saving the flattened entry as a hash, adding the key of the hash to the helper index of entities in the same keyspace, getting existing index structures that might need to be updated, checking if the index exists and what type it is, removing a potentially existing key from the index, removing the helper holding index information, adding the key of the hash to the secondary index of firstnames with the properties value, and adding the index of the secondary index to the set of helper structures for entry to keep track of indexes to clean on delete/update. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/anatomy.html)"
"What is the purpose of projections in Spring Data?","Projections in Spring Data are used to create partial views of managed aggregates, which can be useful when you want to retrieve only specific attributes of an aggregate root. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"What is the difference between closed and open projections in Spring Data?","A closed projection is a projection interface whose accessor methods all match properties of the target aggregate, while an open projection can use @Value annotation to compute new values by using SpEL expressions. Spring Data can optimize query execution for closed projections, but not for open projections. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"How can you use dynamic projections in Spring Data?","To apply dynamic projections in Spring Data, you can use a query method that takes a Class parameter, such as `findByLastname(String lastname, Class<T> type)`. This allows you to select the type to be used at invocation time. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/projections.html)"
"How can you provide custom implementation for repository methods in Spring Data?","To provide custom implementation for repository methods in Spring Data, you must first define a fragment interface and an implementation for the custom functionality. The most important part of the class name that corresponds to the fragment interface is the Impl postfix. The implementation itself does not depend on Spring Data and can be a regular Spring bean. Consequently, you can use standard dependency injection behavior to inject references to other beans (such as a JdbcTemplate), take part in aspects, and so on. Then you can let your repository interface extend the fragment interface. Extending the fragment interface with your repository interface combines the CRUD and custom functionality and makes it available to clients."
"What is the purpose of the repository infrastructure in Spring Data?","The repository infrastructure in Spring Data tries to autodetect custom implementation fragments by scanning for classes below the package in which it found a repository. These classes need to follow the naming convention of appending a postfix defaulting to Impl. The repository infrastructure uses the bean names to identify which custom implementation to use if multiple implementations with matching class names are found in different packages."
"How can you change behavior for all repositories in Spring Data?","To change behavior for all repositories in Spring Data, you can create an implementation that extends the persistence technology-specific repository base class. This class then acts as a custom base class for the repository proxies. The final step is to make the Spring Data infrastructure aware of the customized repository base class by using the repositoryBaseClass in configuration."
"What is the purpose of the @DomainEvents annotation in Spring Data?","The @DomainEvents annotation in Spring Data is used to simplify the publication of domain events from aggregate roots. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"What is the significance of the domainEvents() method in an aggregate root class?","The domainEvents() method in an aggregate root class is annotated with @DomainEvents and returns a collection of events to be published. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @AfterDomainEventPublication annotation in Spring Data?","The @AfterDomainEventPublication annotation in Spring Data is used to specify a method that will be called after all events have been published. It can be used to clean up the list of events to be published or for other purposes. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/core-domain-events.html)"
"How does Spring Data handle null values in repository methods?","Spring Data 2.0 onwards, repository CRUD methods that return an individual aggregate instance use Java 8’s Optional to indicate the potential absence of a value. Query methods can return various wrapper types or opt not to use a wrapper type at all. The absence of a query result is indicated by returning null. Repository methods returning collections, collection alternatives, wrappers, and streams are guaranteed never to return null but rather the corresponding empty representation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/null-handling.html)"
"How can I express nullability constraints for repository methods in Spring Data?","You can use Spring Framework's nullability annotations to express nullability constraints for repository methods. These annotations provide a tooling-friendly approach and opt-in null checks during runtime. The @NonNullApi annotation is used on the package level to declare that the default behavior for parameters and return values is neither to accept nor to produce null values. The @NonNull annotation is used on a parameter or return value that must not be null, and the @Nullable annotation is used on a parameter or return value that can be null. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/null-handling.html)"
"How can I enable runtime checking of nullability constraints for query methods in Spring Data?","To enable runtime checking of nullability constraints for query methods, you need to activate non-nullability on the package level by using Spring's @NonNullApi in package-info.java. Once non-null defaulting is in place, repository query method invocations get validated at runtime for nullability constraints. If a query result violates the defined constraint, an exception is thrown. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/null-handling.html)"
"How does Spring Data Redis support CDI environments?","Spring Data Redis supports CDI environments by shipping with a custom CDI extension that allows you to use the repository abstraction in CDI environments. To activate it, drop the Spring Data Redis JAR into your classpath and implement a CDI Producer for the RedisConnectionFactory and RedisOperations as shown in the example provided. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/cdi-integration.html)"
"What are the steps to set up the infrastructure for CDI integration with Spring Data Redis?","To set up the infrastructure for CDI integration with Spring Data Redis, you need to implement a CDI Producer for the RedisConnectionFactory and RedisOperations. You can do this by following the example provided in the documentation, which includes creating a RedisConnectionFactory and RedisOperations, and setting up the necessary dependencies. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/cdi-integration.html)"
"How do you obtain an instance of a Spring Data repository in a CDI environment?","To obtain an instance of a Spring Data repository in a CDI environment, you need to declare an @Injected property in your Java class. This will allow the Spring Data CDI extension to create a proxy for the Spring Data repository whenever a bean of a repository type is requested by the container. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/redis/redis-repositories/cdi-integration.html)"
"What are the general query method names supported by the Spring Data repository query derivation mechanism?","The general query method names supported by the Spring Data repository query derivation mechanism include find…By, read…By, get…By, query…By, search…By, and stream…By. These methods typically return the repository type, a Collection or Streamable subtype, or a result wrapper such as Page, GeoResults, or any other store-specific result wrapper. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html)"
"What are the logical keyword expressions supported by the Spring Data repository query derivation mechanism?","The logical keyword expressions supported by the Spring Data repository query derivation mechanism include AND, OR, AFTER, BEFORE, CONTAINING, BETWEEN, ENDING_WITH, EXISTS, FALSE, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_EQUALS, IN, IS, IS_EMPTY, IS_NOT_EMPTY, IS_NOT_NULL, IS_NULL, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_EQUAL, LIKE, NEAR, NOT, NOT_IN, NOT_LIKE, REGEX, STARTING_WITH, TRUE, and WITHIN. These keywords can be used to construct complex queries. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html)"
"What is the purpose of the OrderBy… modifier in Spring Data repository query derivation?","The OrderBy… modifier in Spring Data repository query derivation is used to specify a static sorting order followed by the property path and direction. For example, OrderByFirstnameAscLastnameDesc would sort results by the firstname property in ascending order and then by the lastname property in descending order. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/3.3/repositories/query-keywords-reference.html)"

"What is the purpose of projections in Spring Data REST?","Projections in Spring Data REST allow you to alter the view of a domain model and serve up simplified and reduced views of resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"
"How do you define a projection in Spring Data REST?","To define a projection in Spring Data REST, you create a Java interface with the @Projection annotation and include getters for the attributes you want to include in the projection. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"
"What is the difference between a projection and an excerpt in Spring Data REST?","A projection is a simplified view of a single resource, while an excerpt is a projection that is automatically applied to a resource collection. Excerpts provide a default preview of collection data, but not when fetching individual resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"
"How does Spring Data REST handle the representation of domain objects in HTTP requests?","Spring Data REST returns a representation of a domain object that corresponds to the Accept type specified in the HTTP request. Currently, only JSON representations are supported. Other representation types can be supported in the future by adding an appropriate converter and updating the controller methods with the appropriate content-type. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"What happens when the behavior of the Spring Data REST ObjectMapper does not handle a domain model correctly?","If your domain model does not easily lend itself to reading or writing plain JSON, you may want to configure Jackson's ObjectMapper with your own custom mappings, serializers, and deserializers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"How can you register your own custom mappings, serializers, and deserializers with Jackson's ObjectMapper in Spring Data REST?","To add your own Jackson configuration to the ObjectMapper used by Spring Data REST, override the configureJacksonObjectMapper method. That method is passed an ObjectMapper instance that has a special module to handle serializing and deserializing PersistentEntity objects. You can register your own modules as well, as the example shows. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ETag header in Spring Data REST?","The ETag header provides a way to tag resources, preventing clients from overriding each other and reducing unnecessary calls. It can be used to conditionally perform PUT, PATCH, or DELETE operations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"How can the If-None-Match header be used to optimize data retrieval?","The If-None-Match header can be used to conditionally retrieve resources, allowing applications to avoid resending the same data. If the header matches the server-side version, Spring Data REST sends back an HTTP 304 Not Modified status code instead of sending a copy of the resource. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"What is the purpose of the @Version annotation in Spring Data REST?","The @Version annotation flags a field as a version marker. When used with a POJO served up as a REST resource by Spring Data REST, the ETag header is set to the value of the version field. This allows for conditional updates and prevents clients from stomping on each other. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"What are the eight different events emitted by the REST exporter when working with an entity?","The eight different events emitted by the REST exporter are: BeforeCreateEvent, AfterCreateEvent, BeforeSaveEvent, AfterSaveEvent, BeforeLinkSaveEvent, AfterLinkSaveEvent, BeforeDeleteEvent, and AfterDeleteEvent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you subclass an abstract class to listen for these kinds of events and call the appropriate method based on the event type?","To subclass an abstract class that listens for these kinds of events, you can extend the AbstractRepositoryEventListener class and override the methods for the events in question. For example: public class BeforeSaveEventListener extends AbstractRepositoryEventListener { @Override public void onBeforeSave(Object entity) { ... logic to handle inspecting the entity before the Repository saves it } @Override public void onAfterDelete(Object entity) { ... send a message that this entity has been deleted } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you use an annotated handler to filter events based on domain type?","To use an annotated handler, you can create a POJO and put the @RepositoryEventHandler annotation on it. This tells the BeanPostProcessor that this class needs to be inspected for handler methods. Once the BeanPostProcessor finds a bean with this annotation, it iterates over the exposed methods and looks for annotations that correspond to the event in question. To handle BeforeSaveEvent instances in an annotated POJO for different kinds of domain types, you could define your class as follows: @RepositoryEventHandler public class PersonEventHandler { @HandleBeforeSave public void handlePersonSave(Person p) { // … you can now deal with Person in a type-safe way } @HandleBeforeSave public void handleProfileSave(Profile p) { // … you can now deal with Profile in a type-safe way } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"What are the three basic levels of linking available when integrating with Spring Data REST components?","The three basic levels of linking available are: Manually assembling links, using Spring HATEOAS’s LinkBuilder with linkTo(), slash(), and so on, and using Spring Data REST’s implementation of RepositoryEntityLinks. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/integration.html)"
"What is the recommended approach for looking up resource links that are exported by Spring Data REST?","The recommended approach for looking up resource links that are exported by Spring Data REST is to use Spring Data REST’s implementation of RepositoryEntityLinks. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/integration.html)"
"What are some of the operations provided by RepositoryEntityLinks to link to exported resources?","RepositoryEntityLinks provides operations such as linkToCollectionResource(), linkToItemResource(), linkToPagedResource(), linkToSearchResources(), and linkToSearchResource() to link to exported resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/integration.html)"
"What is ALPS and what is its purpose in Spring Data REST?","ALPS (Application-Level Profile Semantics) is a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML microformats. Its purpose in Spring Data REST is to provide a profile document for every exported repository, containing information about both the RESTful transitions and the attributes of each repository. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"What is the structure of the ALPS document for a Spring Data REST app?","The ALPS document for a Spring Data REST app contains information about the resources, their attributes, and the supported operations. It includes a root link, resource links, and a profile link. The profile link contains application-level details and can be accessed by navigating to /profile. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"What types of hypermedia controls are displayed in ALPS?","ALPS displays four types of hypermedia controls: SEMANTIC, SAFE, IDEMPOTENT, and UNSAFE. These types indicate the nature of the state transition triggered by the hypermedia control. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"How can I secure my Spring Data REST services with method-level security?","You can use Spring Security's PreAuthorization model, which is the most sophisticated security model. The following example shows how to secure your Spring Data REST services with method-level security using the PreAuthorization model: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html#security-method-level-security"
"What is the difference between repository-level and method-level security settings in Spring Data REST?","Repository and method-level security settings do not combine. Instead, method-level settings override repository-level settings. This means that if you want to change the security settings for a specific method, you must override the method signature and apply a Spring Security annotation. The preceding example shows that CrudRepository has four delete methods, and you must override all delete methods to properly secure it. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html#security-method-level-security"
"How can I enable method-level security in Spring Data REST?","To enable method-level security in Spring Data REST, you need to use Spring Security's @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity annotation. The following example shows how to configure method-level security in Spring Data REST: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html#security-method-level-security"
"What is the HAL Explorer and who created it?","The HAL Explorer is a useful application created by Kai Tödter. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html})"
"How can you add the HAL Explorer dependency in Maven?","You can add the HAL Explorer dependency in Maven by using the following code: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId> <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-explorer</artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies>. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html})"
"What happens when you click on a NON-GET button with a + or a > sign on it in the HAL Explorer?","When you click on a NON-GET button with a + or a > sign on it in the HAL Explorer, a modal dialog appears. It shows the HTTP method belonging to the clicked button. You can fill the body and submit the new JSON document. (Source: {https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html})"
"How can you customize the URI for item resources in Spring Data REST?","In Spring Data REST, you can customize the URI for item resources by using the configuration API on RepositoryRestConfiguration or by registering an implementation of EntityLookup as a Spring bean in your application. This allows Spring Data REST to tweak the URI generation according to the implementation. You can also register mapping methods as method references to tweak the URI creation. For older Java versions, you should implement a UserEntityLookup that resembles the following: @Component public class UserEntityLookup extends EntityLookupSupport<User> { private final UserRepository repository; public UserEntityLookup(UserRepository repository) { this.repository = repository; } @Override public Serializable getResourceIdentifier(User entity) { return entity.getUsername(); } @Override public Object lookupEntity(Serializable id) { return repository.findByUsername(id.toString()); } } (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing-sdr.html)"
"How can you customize the HTTP methods supported by Spring Data REST?","To customize the HTTP methods supported by Spring Data REST, you can use RepositoryRestConfiguration.getExposureConfiguration(). The class exposes a Lambda-based API to define both global and type-based rules. For example, you can disable the support for HTTP PUT to create item resources directly with config.forDomainType(User.class).disablePutForCreation(). You can also disable the support for HTTP PATCH on all item resources with config.withItemExposure((metadata, httpMethods) -> httpMethods.disable(HttpMethod.PATCH)). (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing-sdr.html)"
"How can you customize the repository exposure in Spring Data REST?","In Spring Data REST, you can customize the repository exposure by explicitly setting a RepositoryDetectionStrategy (usually through the enum RepositoryDetectionStrategies) on RepositoryRestConfiguration. The following values can be configured: ALL, DEFAULT, VISIBILITY, and ANNOTATED. If you need custom rules to apply, you can implement RepositoryDetectionStrategy manually. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing-sdr.html)"
"How can I add custom links to the JSON output of a Spring Data REST application?","You can add custom links to the JSON output of a Spring Data REST application by implementing the RepresentationModelProcessor interface and adding a link to an EntityModel in the process method. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the RepresentationModelProcessor interface in Spring Data REST?","The RepresentationModelProcessor interface is used to alter the representation of resources that go out to the client in Spring Data REST. It allows you to customize the JSON output of your application. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>)"
"How can I completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in a Spring Data REST application?","To completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in a Spring Data REST application, you can register your own ConversionService in the ApplicationContext and register your own Converter<Entity, EntityModel> to return a EntityModel implementation of your choosing. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>)"
"What is the purpose of custom serializers and deserializers in Spring Data REST?","Custom serializers and deserializers in Spring Data REST are used to handle domain models that do not easily translate to JSON. They provide a way to configure Jackson's ObjectMapper with custom type mappings and (de)serializers to accommodate use cases where the default configuration may not handle the domain model correctly."
"How can you register a type mapping for an abstract class or interface in Spring Data REST?","To register a type mapping for an abstract class or interface in Spring Data REST, you can create a Module bean and, in the setupModule method, add an appropriate TypeResolver. This can be done by using the SimpleAbstractTypeResolver and adding a mapping for the abstract class or interface."
"How do you add custom serializers and deserializers for domain types in Spring Data REST?","To add custom serializers and deserializers for domain types in Spring Data REST, you can register your own implementations with Jackson's ObjectMapper. This can be done by creating a Module bean and, in the setupModule method, adding the serializers and deserializers using SimpleSerializers and SimpleDeserializers."

"What is the default status code for a POST request that creates a new resource in Spring Data REST?","201 Created (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/repository-resources.html)"
"What is the purpose of projections in Spring Data REST?","Projections in Spring Data REST are used to alter the view of the domain model and serve up simplified and reduced views of resources. They can be used to reduce the information presented to the user or bring in normally unseen data. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"
"How can you apply an excerpt projection to a resource collection?","To apply an excerpt projection to a resource collection, you can alter the repository definition by using the @RepositoryRestResource annotation and setting the excerptProjection attribute to the desired projection. This will cause Spring Data REST to use the specified projection when embedding resources into collections or related resources. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"
"How can you include commonly accessed data inline in a resource representation?","To include commonly accessed data inline in a resource representation, you can define an excerpt projection that includes the desired fields or getters. This projection can then be applied to the repository definition using the @RepositoryRestResource annotation, causing the information to be included inline in the resource representation. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/projections-excerpts.html)"

(Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/representations.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ETag header in Spring Data REST?","The ETag header provides a way to tag resources, preventing clients from overriding each other and making it possible to reduce unnecessary calls. It can be used to conditionally PUT, PATCH, or DELETE a resource if a If-Match header is supplied. If the resource's current ETag state matches the If-Match header, the operation is carried out. This safeguard prevents clients from stomping on each other. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"What is the difference between the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers in Spring Data REST?","The If-None-Match header allows conditional queries, while the If-Modified-Since header provides a way to check whether a resource has been updated since the last request. The If-None-Match header lets applications avoid resending the same data, while the If-Modified-Since header avoids fetching the same data twice when it has not been updated. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"How can you architect a more efficient front end using ETag elements and Last-Modified values in Spring Data REST?","To architect a more efficient front end, you can identify the entities that need locking and add a version attribute. Identify the entries that would benefit from tracking the most recent updates and store the Last-Modified value in the DOM. When fetching resources, also embed self URIs in your DOM nodes. Adjust PUT/PATCH/DELETE operations to use If-Match and handle HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status codes. Adjust GET operations to use If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since and handle HTTP 304 Not Modified status codes. By embedding ETag elements and Last-Modified values in your DOM, you can reduce the consumption of data and battery power by not retrieving the same thing over and over. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/etags-and-other-conditionals.html)"
"How can you register a Validator instance in Spring Data REST?","You can register a Validator instance in Spring Data REST by either wiring it by bean name or registering the validator manually. For the majority of cases, the simple bean name prefix style is sufficient. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/validation.html)"
"How do you tell Spring Data REST to assign a particular Validator to a specific event?","To tell Spring Data REST you want a particular Validator assigned to a particular event, prefix the bean name with the event in question. For example, to validate instances of the Person class before new ones are saved into the repository, you would declare an instance of a Validator<Person> in your ApplicationContext with a bean name of beforeCreatePersonValidator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/validation.html)"
"How can you assign Validators manually in Spring Data REST?","If you would rather not use the bean name prefix approach, you need to register an instance of your validator with the bean whose job it is to invoke validators after the correct event. In your configuration that implements RepositoryRestConfigurer, override the configureValidatingRepositoryEventListener method and call addValidator on the ValidatingRepositoryEventListener, passing the event on which you want this validator to be triggered and an instance of the validator. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/validation.html)"
"What are the eight different events emitted by the REST exporter in Spring Data REST?","The REST exporter emits eight different events: BeforeCreateEvent, AfterCreateEvent, BeforeSaveEvent, AfterSaveEvent, BeforeLinkSaveEvent, AfterLinkSaveEvent, BeforeDeleteEvent, and AfterDeleteEvent. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you write an ApplicationListener to handle these events in Spring Data REST?","To write an ApplicationListener, subclass the AbstractRepositoryEventListener and override the methods for the events in question. This approach makes no distinction based on the type of the entity, so you have to inspect that yourself. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"How can you write an annotated handler to filter events based on domain type in Spring Data REST?","To write an annotated handler, create a POJO and put the @RepositoryEventHandler annotation on it. This tells the BeanPostProcessor to inspect the class for handler methods. Once the BeanPostProcessor finds a bean with this annotation, it iterates over the exposed methods and looks for annotations that correspond to the event in question. The domain type whose events you are interested in is determined from the type of the first parameter of the annotated methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/events.html)"
"What is the purpose of the ALPS draft spec and how does it relate to Spring Data REST?","The ALPS draft spec is meant to define a particular profile format, which is used by Spring Data REST to provide detailed metadata about the application's semantics and the attributes of each repository. This increased reusability of profile documents across media types allows clients to deduce not only the available RESTful transitions but also, to some degree, the data elements needed to interact with the back end. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"What is the difference between the media types of application/alps+json and application/hal+json?","The media type of application/alps+json is used for the ALPS format, which is a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics. On the other hand, the media type of application/hal+json is used for the HAL format, which is a hypermedia-driven RESTful API style. These two formats are different and governed by different specifications. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"How can you add custom messages to your ALPS metadata in a Spring Data REST application?","To add custom messages to your ALPS metadata in a Spring Data REST application, you can create a rest-messages.properties file and define rest.description.* properties to display details for a specific resource. These properties alter the ALPS format of the resource representation by adding an extra doc attribute to each field. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/metadata.html)"
"How can you secure Spring Data REST services with method-level security using Spring Security?","You can secure Spring Data REST services with method-level security using Spring Security by applying the @PreAuthorize annotation to the methods in the repository. The @PreAuthorize annotation allows you to specify a Spring Security SpEL expression that checks the user's roles before executing the method. For example, to secure the entire repository, you can apply the @PreAuthorize annotation to the repository interface, and to change method-level settings, you must override the method signature and apply the @PreAuthorize annotation. The method-level settings override the repository-level settings. To enable method-level security, you need to use the @EnableMethodSecurity annotation in your Spring configuration class. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html)"
"What is the difference between the @PreAuthorize annotation and the @Secured annotation in Spring Security?","The @PreAuthorize annotation is more flexible than the @Secured annotation in Spring Security. The @PreAuthorize annotation allows you to specify a Spring Security SpEL expression that checks the user's roles, permissions, or any other expression. The @Secured annotation, on the other hand, is purely role-based and allows only roles as the means to restrict access. If you are starting with a new project or first applying Spring Security, the @PreAuthorize annotation is recommended. If you are already using Spring Security with @Secured in other parts of your app, you can continue on that path without rewriting everything. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/security.html)"
"How can you configure method-level security in Spring Data REST using Spring Security?","To configure method-level security in Spring Data REST using Spring Security, you need to use the @EnableMethodSecurity annotation in your Spring configuration class. The @EnableMethodSecurity annotation enables both @Secured and @Pre/@Post support. You can use the securedEnabled and prePostEnabled attributes to enable or disable the respective security features. For example, to enable both @Secured and @Pre/@Post support, you can use the following annotation: @EnableMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true, prePostEnabled = true).

It shows the HTTP method belonging to the clicked button. You can fill the body and submit the new JSON document. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/tools.html)"
"What annotation should be used to create a custom handler for a specific resource in Spring Data REST?","@RepositoryRestController (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/overriding-sdr-response-handlers.html>)"
"How can I override the default response handlers in Spring Data REST?","You can override the default response handlers by using the @RepositoryRestController annotation instead of a standard Spring MVC @Controller or @RestController. This allows you to take advantage of Spring Data REST's settings, message converters, exception handling, and more. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/overriding-sdr-response-handlers.html>)"
"What is the purpose of the AggregateReference class in Spring Data REST?","The AggregateReference class is used to capture references to other resources in custom controllers receiving PUT and POST requests. It can resolve these references into either the referenced aggregate's identifier, the aggregate itself, or a jMolecules Association. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/overriding-sdr-response-handlers.html>)"
"How can I add links to the default representation of an entity in Spring Data REST?","You can add links to the default representation of an entity in Spring Data REST by calling model.add(Link) as shown in the example. Any links you add to the EntityModel are added to the final output. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>) "
"What is the purpose of the RepresentationModelProcessor interface in Spring Data REST?","The RepresentationModelProcessor interface is used to process entities and alter the representation of resources that go out to the client. All beans of type RepresentationModelProcessor<EntityModel<T>> are automatically picked up by the Spring Data REST exporter and triggered when serializing an entity of type T. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>) "
"How can I completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in Spring Data REST?","To completely replace the default outgoing JSON representation in Spring Data REST, you can register your own ConversionService in the ApplicationContext and register your own Converter<Entity, EntityModel>. You can then return a EntityModel implementation of your choosing. (Source: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/customizing-json-output.html>) "
"How can I handle complex domain models that do not easily translate to JSON using Spring Data REST?","You can configure Jackson's ObjectMapper with your own custom type mappings and (de)serializers. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/custom-jackson-deserialization.html)"
"What is the purpose of the setupModule method in a custom Jackson Module bean for Spring Data REST?","The setupModule method allows you to configure Jackson's JSON mapping and perform various customizations. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/custom-jackson-deserialization.html)"
"How can I register custom serializers and deserializers for domain types in Spring Data REST?","You can add serializers and deserializers from your setupModule method implementation by adding them to the SimpleSerializers and SimpleDeserializers objects and then adding them to the context. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/custom-jackson-deserialization.html)"
"What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Spring Data REST?","The purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Spring Data REST is to enable specific HTTP resources to be accessible when working with client-side HTTP requests issued by a browser. This is important because browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources residing outside the current origin for security reasons. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/configuring-cors.html)"
"How can you enable CORS for a whole repository in Spring Data REST?","You can enable CORS for a whole repository in Spring Data REST by adding a @CrossOrigin annotation to your repository interfaces. By default, @CrossOrigin allows all origins and HTTP methods. (Source: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/reference/4.3/customizing/configuring-cors.html)"
"How can you add global CORS configuration in Spring Data REST?","You can add global CORS configuration in Spring Data REST by implementing the RepositoryRestConfigurer interface and overriding the configureRepositoryRestConfiguration method. This method takes a RepositoryRestConfiguration and a CorsRegistry as parameters, allowing you to configure CORS settings such as allowed origins, methods, and headers.
